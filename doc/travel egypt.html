<td colspan="2" rowspan="1">
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">On
April 8-22 Maxine and I took a Lindblad/National Geographic tour
of Egypt.</span></p>
<p style="font-style: italic;" class="MsoNormal">This
account starts with some general observations that the trip triggered
and then goes through events day by day.&nbsp;</p><p style="font-style: italic;" class="MsoNormal">NOTE:
Maxine thinks my opening comments about our six fellow travelers were
inappropriate. &nbsp;I don't, but until all this is clearer to me, I'm
deleting that section. &nbsp;The core message: there was a deep incompatibility between some of them and me.</p><p style="font-style: italic;" class="MsoNormal">References to "H." are to our guide.</p>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><i></i><p class="MsoNormal" style="page-break-after: avoid;"><i>Money,
money, money<o:p></o:p></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Guidebooks had warned about the
frequency with&nbsp;which money
would be solicited or conned from us, while assuring me that small
tipping
(baksheesh) is an important custom not to be ignored.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I wanted to accept this, but&#8230;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I will break small-scale money
annoyances into three parts:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Required service
for minor necessary matters, most tellingly tips for toilet attendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>H. had told us to do as
Egyptians and tip 1
pound (about 18 cents).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
felt chintzy
about that, however, and the attendants&#8217; (almost always women in
religious
garb) roles of handing out toilet paper and keeping the lavatories
relatively
clean seemed to me so noxious, that I routinely tipped 5 pounds on the
principle that they needed the money far more than I.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Although a service charge is
typically included in a meal
bill, much of this apparently doesn&#8217;t actually go to waitstaff and so
you're
supposed to add maybe 10%.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A subcategory here is
unnecessary services for which
baksheesh is apparently traditional, such as if someone holds a door
for
you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since other
than doormen (never
women) at our fancy hotels no one held a door for me, I didn&#8217;t have to
address
this category.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unnecessary
services foisted upon the unwary tourist by people of all ages (though
almost
always male) and all job categories (again, men, including the tourism
police).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The most common scam of this
sort, or rather the one I most
remembered from the guidebooks, was offering to be photographed and
then
demanding payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
I avoided this
until a tourist, uniformed cop invited me to photograph him on a camel;
this is
when I learned that Egyptian cops could be as venal as cops anywhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Driving outside Moscow in
1965, my two
companions and I were stopped thrice by traffic cops, each of whom
commandeered
one rouble from us.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In all such cases, payment is
never mentioned until after
performance of a service you never realized was one.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When offering the service, the man will be
ingratiatingly
submissive with the tone of doing something for you because you are
clearly
someone special.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
if you don&#8217;t tip
something because you didn&#8217;t ask for the &#8220;service,&#8221; he&#8217;ll pursue you in
simulated outrage as though you're cheating him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The &#8220;service&#8221; is often encouragement to ignore some
law or
principle of common sense that would help protect an ancient site;
apparently
many tourists are eager to abuse artifacts for their private
gratification.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The first time I got duped in
this way was entering a tomb
in the Valley of the Kings and being handed a flashlight by a winking
ticket-taker.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For a
moment I thought
everyone got a flashlight, but a few steps inside the tomb I realized
otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
flashlight was no use to
me&#8212;indeed a burden because I had to carry it&#8212;and had a nearly
burned-out bulb
even if I wanted to use it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
I
left, I handed the ticket-taker the flashlight and his tone reversed as
he
gestured for baksheesh.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was
sufficiently intimidated to hand him a pound (at which he sneered) but
sufficiently angry to give him nothing more.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A flashlight gambit occurred
again in the Valley of the
Queens, in a tomb for a foetal prince (i.e., a miscarried boy of a
pharaoh&#8217;s
wife&#8212;I don&#8217;t think this was common).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Here a tomb guard whipped out a flashlight to
illuminate the foetus
(a<span style="">&nbsp; </span>tiny skeleton).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was actually helpful,
except that we
had a flashlight of our own&#8230;.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
shone
the light inside the sarcophagus (I can&#8217;t remember if there was
anything to
see)&#8212;and then on a ceiling tile which he proceeded to rub vigorously
and
offered me, with an ingratiating pooh-poohing of my resistance, to rub.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a moment of startled
silence at this
obviously common abuse of ancient material, and resisting the desire to
pull
his hand away from what he was rubbing, I refused the invitation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On the next-to-last day of the
trip, at the Giza pyramids, I
had just taken a photo of Maxine when a local middle-aged man in
galibeeyah
stepped up and gestured for me to hand him the camera to take a picture
of
Maxine and me together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sucker
that I
am, I took him at face value as a genuinely friendly local (though I
kept a
careful eye on the camera&#8230;).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even
as
Maxine and I were posing, two cohorts came up, yukking it up with great
camaraderie, and, as their colleague snapped away, posing with us and
draping
me and Maxine in Arab headdresses, as in the following wretchedly
framed photo:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 800px; height: 533px;" alt="max-me-con%20guy%20at%20giza.jpg" src="max-me-con%20guy%20at%20giza.jpg"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My eye on the camera (and my
nerve-endings on my various
pockets), I took back the camera as its holder genially informed me
that $5
would be fine for all three of them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(What I <i>should </i>have done was
show him each photo he took and
delete it in front of him&#8212;another of life&#8217;s endless examples of wisdom
after
the fact.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I pulled
out a 5-pound
note.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;No, no.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dollars!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My intimidated hand returned the note to my pocket
and pulled out my
wallet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A dollar
bill passed into his
hand and I started to walk away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;No,
no, the others!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
more hesitancy I
fished out another dollar bill and handed it to the second fellow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I began to walk away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The third
shuffled&nbsp;alongside as I walked,
variously demanding and pleading in Arabic in unmistakeable tones and
gestures,
&#8220;What about me?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
waved to him to share
with the others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eventually
he backed
off&#8212;but only after, I think, a fourth man, involved with camel rides we
were
about to take, signaled him with a nod to leave.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As we walked towards the camels, this fellow
jovially asked if I
was happy now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;No,&#8221;
I said.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He looked
puzzled, and we proceeded to the
camels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wonder
how many people worked
this location together.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">These experiences remind me of
squeegee men&#8212;those guys who
wipe (I won&#8217;t say &#8220;clean&#8221;) your windshield as you wait in traffic in a
large
American city and then expect payment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In that case, there&#8217;s an added factor of physical
intimidation: the
squeegee guy will seem to behave as though he has performed a service
for which failure
to pay is a kind of assault.<span style="">
&nbsp;(I've never seen one of these guys actually being
threatening--I think that image is a projection of us
drivers.)&nbsp; </span>Just as in
a U.S. city, the Egyptian version often has a&nbsp;racial dimension
and tension:
in New York City my experience of the squeegee con is of black youths,
probably
dressing to fit the worst white stereotypes, &#8220;cleaning&#8221; the windshields
of white drivers
who respond as desired to the stereotypes; aside from any fear
generated by the
interaction, the context is intensified by whatever white guilt runs
through
the drivers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(For
all I know, the
squeegee men are equal-opportunity predators without regard to race,
ethnicity
or religion.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
Egypt, instead of
black-and-white, the dynamic is native-vs.-foreigner: the dark-skinned
scammers
dress in traditional (or what I think of as traditional) Arab garb
(quite
possibly their dress of choice in any event) and play the stereotype of
the
obsequious and friendly local on the one hand, the aggressive and
aggrieved
victim of colonial chauvinists on the other.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I expect many of these guys are perfectly decent
sorts when they're with
friends and family, as many of the squeegee men may well be.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">3.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Souvenir
vendors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Virtually
every public area to
which a tourist might go is chockablock with vendors of schlock
items&#8212;postcards,
shirts, lute-like instruments, statuettes of pharaohs and camels and
tomb
relics, jewelry, souvenir pencils, maps&#8230;.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These people are
aggressive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
push things in your
face, they block your path, if you don&#8217;t reply to them they speak more
loudly
and then tap your arm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
shout
prices in your ear, then lower the prices if you don&#8217;t engage with them
at once.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Guidebooks
seem to portray this behavior as
endearingly authentic and encourage tourists to go into bargaining
mode.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They act as
if they can&#8217;t believe you don&#8217;t
want to buy their wares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
ask you
questions like, &#8220;Where are you from?&#8221; not of course because they care
but as a
way to get you to start talking to them so they can wheedle in return;
I was bemused by how many tourists, out of some code of behavior
irrelevant to this context, felt obligated to reply to such questions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In cities this happens pretty
much anywhere you go (tourist
pathways are highly predictable, after all), and elsewhere it happens
on the
way into tourists sites.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
addition,
on the way <i>out</i>, which is rarely the way you came
in, you almost always
have to pass through an arcade of souvenir stands and itinerant sellers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you take a boat to
cross a river or lake
to a site, the &#8220;pilot&#8221; is like as not to uncover his own set of wares
in the
midst of the boat.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">The
vendors apparently are individual entrepreneurs who get their wares
from local
suppliers who know them and give them time to pay for the goods they
take to
sell.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" class="MsoNormal">*
* * *&nbsp;* * * *&nbsp;* * * *&nbsp;* * * *</p>
<p class="stblpara">I&#8217;d like to say that my hatred
of the scams and the intrusive
vendors is motivated by the desire not to enable demeaning behavior,
however
patrician that might be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
that&#8217;s not
true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I viscerally
recoil in anger at
the behavior with its presumptuous intrusion on my movements and
thoughts even as I dismayingly recognize its deeper truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="stblpara">I do believe that such behavior
is the result of social and
economic conditions that provide little opportunity for meaningful
engagement
with the economy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Islam
encourages
charity, but it also encourages virtuous and satisfying lives for its congregants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I seriously doubt that the
culture of
baksheesh and let-me-tell-you-what-I-think-you-want-to-hear is part of
that
tradition, especially since so much of this behavior is directed at
non-Muslim
tourists who cannot be expected to empathize with a Muslim tradition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I suspect, rather, that at
least part of the
source for the behavior stems from the 19<sup>th</sup>-century
Middle Eastern
bull market in European and American tourism.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(I should look back at Edward Said&#8217;s <i>Orientalism</i>,
which probably
illuminates some of this context and is a great book for getting
perspective on
Western images of &#8220;Oriental&#8221; cultures.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A useful, much shorter 2004 complement on how those
same cultures have
viewed the West is Ian Buruma and Avishai Margalit, <i>Occidentalism</i>.)</p>
<p class="stblpara">The situation is intractable,
and we tourists have
culpability, if not in our immediate behavior then in the lives we have
inherited in our homelands as a result of past colonialism and
imperialism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any
foreigner&#8212;probably any
Westerner in particular&#8212;who can afford to make these tours surely has
enough
money to pay out pittances to local residents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And after all, isn&#8217;t the service provider giving at
least the semblance of
actually working and not asking for a handout?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And given the history of Western exploitation of (in
this case) Egyptian
resources, geological as well as cultural, don&#8217;t we owe something in
return?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer
to these questions, of
course, is &#8220;yes.&#8221;</p>
<p class="stblpara">More.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is a crime
and an outrage that so many men (and sometimes women, sometimes
children) are
reduced to such self-abasing behavior to survive, that their leaders
don&#8217;t
provide enough meaningful&nbsp;opportunities to earn a living, that
our
own government is in collusion to maintain this regime in power
regardless of
its attention or inattention to the well being of its citizens, its
abuse of
civil liberties, its manipulation of elections.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Why isn&#8217;t our government demanding accountability
from theirs
instead of colluding with it to send for torture prisoners to whom we
have
denied <i>habeus corpus</i>?</p>
<p class="stblpara">Do we really believe that so
many men are content to be
reduced to the level of wheedling other human beings (or sometimes to
involve
their own wives or children in the wheedling)?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Do they really enjoy bargaining over trifles to feed
themselves and
their families?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Deep
down, perhaps at
an unconscious level, does it gratify them to adopt the obsequious
veneer used to lure us to their spiels, or the righteous anger if we
don&#8217;t come
through as they want?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is
the
satisfaction they get from promoting crap as worthwhile goods or
&#8220;winning&#8221; a
&#8220;negotiation&#8221; really the highest end of any human life?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Or isn&#8217;t that a rationalization for the fact
that they feel they have nowhere else to turn for dignity and
achievement? </p>
<p class="stblpara">For such people we must be
walking ATMs for which they have a
few passwords that log them in a fair amount of the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And we do hold the cash,
the means to their daily well
being.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why do we
avert our eyes from
the sadness and in many ways hopelessness of their plight and instead
gloat
when we bargain a few pennies in our favor that mean nothing to us and
a great
deal to them?<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="stblpara">When a ticket-taker or guard or
cop offers to perform or
allow illegal services, it is a reminder that whatever the official
line,
the ancient heritage of their land has little meaning other than as an
income
source for people desperate to feed themselves and their families.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Romans long after the
fall of the&nbsp;Empire (for example) lived among their ruins
herding goats and chipping off
useful chunks of stone, so ordinary Egyptians now and in centuries
before have
often seen their monuments as free housing, sources of building
material,
structures within their villages of importance only if they could be
used for
something (like table surfaces).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why
should
their heritage mean to them what it means to visitors (or what the
visitors are
told it means) and their own, distant, social and intellectual upper
crust?</p>
<p class="stblpara">Today, for whatever their
mysterious drawing power, these
decrepit ruins attract tourists (including me) by the ton.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These visitors may be
quietly loathed for
expecting special treatment (which they get) and reducing local people
to
servants or walk-ons for scenic verisimilitude, but the foolish
tourists will
pay (or can be intimidated into paying) if you help them treat the
monuments as
their personal property for at least a few seconds.</p>
<p class="stblpara">Surely not helping to change
such an attitude is the fact little by little the central government is
re-locating people who have been living on promising sites for
excavation and will likely be doing so for some time to come.
&nbsp;Near the Valley of the Kings is a large swathe of land that
until recently had local homes--hovels, more than likely, but how many
times have enlightened governments (including our own--recall the TVA,
for example, and other infrastructure building plans) forced seemingly
improved living conditions on stubborn people who don't want to leave
what may have been family land for generations? &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" class="stblpara">*
* * *&nbsp;* * * *&nbsp;* * * *&nbsp;* * * *</p>
<p class="stblpara">Our trip included a 6-day Nile
cruise with many stops at
ancient sites.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
we sailed lazily in
the middle of the river, we might wave at little children on the bank
who often
waved and called to us words we didn&#8217;t understand.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="stblpara"><img style="width: 800px; height: 533px;" alt="nile kids waving" src="nile%20qena%20to%20luxor%20children%20waving-calling.JPG"></p>
<p class="stblpara">I formed the conceit that we
were visible gods regally floating
by and gracing them with useless benedictions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And for all we know, they <i>are</i>
calling for help, sustenance,
support.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Except for
these picturesque,
romanticized moments we will never be relevant to their lives nor they
to
ours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cultural
and economic chasm
in the 100 yards between us might as well be parsecs between stars.</p>
<p class="stblpara">These people have no reason to
like us or treat us well, and
those who do may be fools, traitors to their countrypeople, rather than
gentle
folk who rise above economic inequities and communicate on a universal
plane of
humanity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why <i>should
</i>there be
peace between us or respect or any feelings other than envy and anger?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We from the West who take
these tours are
cultural descendants, and in some cases biological descendants, of
those who
exploited their grandparents and great-grandparents and connived with
their
rulers to bleed their land of resources and keep them in their states
of
stubborn survival.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I
don&#8217;t say
&#8220;misery&#8221; because I suspect people like this find ways to enjoy their
private
lives with family and friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Allah
or
Amun-Ra help them if they can&#8217;t.)</p>
<p class="stblpara">In the last few days of our
tour, I realized that I wasn&#8217;t
looking at Egyptians as individuals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because to look at them was taken as a signal to
engage in some kind of
negotiation, I avoided seeing their faces&#8212;just as I assume they, who
must see
tens of thousands of tourists in a year, make no differentiation among
us
tourists beyond nationality and language.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So I
pushed myself to start looking even if it brought attention, which
after all I
knew how to sidestep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However
much I
hated the generic behavior towards me, I began to see them as
individual human
beings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And quite
by accident, I may have
found a non-hostile way to turn them away.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="stblpara">Up until then I had at best
coldly said &#8220;No, thank you&#8221; in
Arabic, and if they persisted I raised my voice and firmly repeated,
&#8220;La, la,
la!&#8221; (&#8220;no, no, no&#8221;!).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
at our final
day&#8217;s visit to the very first stab at building a pyramid (the &#8220;step&#8221;
pyramid),
when a vendor approached me and asked what I would like, I found myself
looking
at him and saying, &#8220;I really would like just to be left alone.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said something that I
thought was a
prelude to pursuing the matter, and I started to protest, but in fact
he was
walking away saying something equivalent to, &#8220;That&#8217;s cool.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn&#8217;t get another
chance to see if this
approach would work routinely&#8212;to see if, in short, some kind of bridge
between
me and &#8220;them&#8221; is possible without mutual contempt</p>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Miscellaneous observations</span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>
<p>When they were available, I read English language
newspapers. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>I was surprised to read that Egyptians had <span style="font-style: italic;">some </span>legal
recourse against perceived injustice; I was not surprised to learn that
this process could readily be subverted, and that the availability of a
justice
system did not mean people were always allowed to have recourse to it.</li>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></span>It
is against the law to deface pictures of the president, Hosni Mubarak.
&nbsp;A TV network or film company had been fined for televising
film
of a demonstration that did exactly that. &nbsp;Originally fined
maybe
$25,000, they just won a court appeal that reversed the verdict on the
basis of insufficient evidence.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>For many months an Egyptian blogger had been
jailed for (allegedly, but probably really) anti-state postings.
&nbsp;He has just had his 8th court
order for release, but the police retain him.</li>
</ul>
<li>The papers report
unfavorably on Israel treatment of Palestineans. &nbsp;(I usually
agree with the tenor of such claims; I just doubt that the reporting is
any less one-sided in its way than pro-Israel reporting in the
U.S.) &nbsp;At the same
time, they published reports that an Egyptian official has agreed to
meet with the new (and extreme right-wing) foreign minister of Israel,
Avidor Lieberman, and that there is controversy over whether this is
the right thing to do. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Some Hezbollah members in Egypt were recently
arrested for plotting against
Israel. &nbsp;The Egyptian government is issuing firm
pronouncements
about the rightness of doing this, but the papers also report
opposition to the arrests in other middle-east countries.</li>
<li>Archaeological
discoveries are given top coverage. &nbsp;The possibility that the
burial location and mummies of Antony and Cleopatra have been
discovered
got prominent play. &nbsp;So did the discovery of 53 tombs
(covering
2000 years) that had been unearthed near Fayum (maybe 50 miles
southwest of
Cairo), complete with colored photographs of some of the finds.
&nbsp;In both cases, Zahi Hawass (head of the Egyptian antiquities
department and someone from whose comments it is hard to escape) got
his face and words into the
reports.</li>
<li>A government regulatory agency has
promulgated tight restrictions on the distribution of cement (actually,
has taken steps to make cement much more readily available), as a
result of which the price
of cement has been reported to be dropping. &nbsp;Of course, I can
never
be sure whether such official positions are real or posturing.
&nbsp;In
many places where construction seemed to be going on, I did notice
large troves of stacked bags of cement. &nbsp;For example:</li>
</ul>
<img style="width: 800px; height: 533px;" alt="cement bags" src="cement%20bags%20better.JPG"><br>
<ul>
<li>The
Coptic Orthodox Easter was widely publicized. &nbsp; Only 19% of
Egyptians are Christian, but the day is a national holiday.
&nbsp;(I read that there are 1000 Jews
left in the country. &nbsp;And on a related Egypt-and-Jews note, I
understand that the only "historical" evidence for the Exodus is the
Old Testament.)
&nbsp;For Easter, it is a widespread tradition to eat a special,
very
salty
fish; a news article reported government discouragement of this
practice because, while when properly prepared the fish can be
enjoyable, if NOT properly prepared (as in having been purchased on the
cheap) it can be poisonous.</li>
</ul>
<p class="stblpara">History and vandalism before the advent of the Vandals:&nbsp;We
(and that includes me) typically mourn and shake our
heads in disbelief when we learn that a particular historical monument
has been
defaced or destroyed by zealots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(We're
not so happy, either, when the destruction comes from natural forces,
like the recent area near Rome devastated by an earthquake, but we're
more easily philosophical about that than when humans are behind the
destruction.) &nbsp;Remember those
two giant Buddhas blown up by the Taliban in Afghanistan a few years
before 9/11?&nbsp;However much I lament such
seemingly brainless and doctrinaire behavior, however, I have to
understand that it,
too, is part of the history of the region and its cultures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In ancient Egypt, two
traditions of this
sort are prominent in my mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During
dynastic
times,&nbsp;pharaohs would sometimes try to erase evidence of a
hated predecessor, most
notably by having his (or her) various names chiseled
off&nbsp;monuments and friezes,
but sometimes by having images themselves destroyed or altered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Pharaohs had at least
five names, and
knowing the secret ones could give one unacceptable power over the
corresponding pharaoh.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
second
example is Upper (i.e., southern) Egypt Christians of the first several
centuries AD: where they found &#8220;pagan&#8221; carvings they would chisel away
everything within bodily outlines, so that you can still kind of
recognize a
shape but can see no detail within it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was no easy task: such vandalism is widespread
within and among
monuments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why did
they do this?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Probably
multiple reasons: purging
temptations to &#8220;paganism,&#8221; obliterating obscene images (i.e., bare
flesh
uncovered by tunics), proving their own piety and diligence (this was
long hard
labor; many of the images were above a man&#8217;s height).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What seems to have saved many carvings is that they
were covered
with windswept sand and other detritus so that the vandals could not
see
them&#8212;and apparently did not think to search below ground next to images
they <i>could
</i>see.<span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>
The government clearly takes its tourism seriously and has
many security safeguards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All
of that,
I gather, is in response to a 1997 terrorist attack that killed over 50
tourists and must have severely damaged Egypt&#8217;s foreign currency influx
from
tourism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I recall
a very recent
kidnapping of several tourists who had traveled to a quite
out-of-the-way
location in Upper Egypt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
drive to a
number of areas is either forbidden or requires&nbsp;joining a
scheduled policy
convoy.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tour
groups are closely
monitored.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tour
leaders have to notify
the government (presumably the tourism ministry) of their daily
schedules, and
at each site police check on the buses going in and out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Entrances have barriers in
staggered rows to
deter vehicles smashing through (though to me it looked as though a
determined
driver with a reinforced vehicle could get through them).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tour groups over 10 people
require police
escorts everywhere they go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I
assume
the tour companies have to pay the salaries.)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the Nile cruise we had 2 to 4 cops with machine
guns (blurred in the photo) on board, in the stern of the communal
outdoor deck, every day:<br>
<img style="width: 800px; height: 1200px;" alt="triton cops" src="triton%20guards.JPG"><br>
In our last days in Cairo we had a cop in plain clothes on the bus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His weapon appeared to be
some kind of small
machine gun that ran the width of the back of his jacket and was
obvious even
to my untrained eye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
may be a little hard to see in this photo, but look at his jacket
between and just below the elbows.<br>
<img style="width: 800px; height: 1352px;" alt="plainclothes cop" src="saqqara%20plainclothes%20cop%20from%20rear.jpg"><br>
I don&#8217;t think I
felt any safer with a cop aboard our buses, at least.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It
seemed to me he made a handy target, and that any self-respecting
attackers
would start by machine-gunning the windshield (is it, perhaps, bulletproof? if so, how to what degree?) of a bus , behind which
the cops
sit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On our final
afternoon in Cairo
Maxine and I were supposed to go by ourselves to Old Cairo, but it
turned out
that a cop and guide were required to go with any tour members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I don&#8217;t know what laws I
broke when I took
a cab by myself.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
multiple reasons
we decided against the excursion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But
the knowledge made me feel trapped.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What if I wanted to get around by myself&#8212;for example
take the Cairo
Metro somewhere? &nbsp;Between the tour itinerary and legal
requirements, we were shielded from a great deal of Egyptian life.
&nbsp;Going on our own would have given us much more freedom, but
also much less understanding of what we were seeing or where exactly we
should go.
<p class="stblpara">Pretty
much every public place you go--monuments,
hotels, stores--has a metal detector at the entryway. &nbsp;I always set it off,
but no
guard&nbsp;ever stopped me. &nbsp;At our last hotel, however, I
saw an
Egyptian wedding party coming through the detector, and <span style="font-style: italic;">they </span>were checked.
&nbsp;All people are equal but tourists are more equal
than&nbsp;Egyptians.</p>
<p class="stblpara">Except in affluent areas,
garbage is widespread on sidewalks, embankments and irrigation canals.
&nbsp;I say this not to sneer but to depict an example of the
distance between the elite and the rest of the population in this
society. &nbsp;Here's a scene from a small Nile town below (that
is, north of) Luxor:</p>
<img style="width: 800px; height: 533px;" alt="nile garbage" src="nile%20going%20north%20to%20luxor%20garbage.JPG">And
along an irrigation canal outside Cairo that feeds agricultural fields
(notice also the incomplete buildings and laundry hanging out to dry,
both common sights wherever we went):<br>
<img style="width: 800px; height: 533px;" alt="garbage irrigation canal" src="garbage%20on%20irrigation%20canal.JPG">And in
modern-day Memphis (near Cairo, a visit on our last day):<br>
<img style="width: 800px; height: 533px;" alt="memphis garbage" src="memphis%20garbage.jpg">
<p class="stblpara">Cairo traffic
is routinely worse than even Manhattan at rush hour. &nbsp;Traffic
lights appear to be optional, and drivers readily switch lanes with
little room to spare. &nbsp;(I noticed that taxis, at least, were
quite
banged up.<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>
&nbsp;Apparently a minor brush or "kiss" is
ignored.)&nbsp;Crossing the street in such traffic seems
death-defying, but it
looked to me as though drivers and pedestrians had a silent pact that
allowed both of them to move with little room to spare.</p>
<p class="stblpara">Many ordinary Egyptians
volunteered their enthusiasm for Obama.</p>
<p class="stblpara">References to "pagan," i.e.,
pre-Christian (and maybe pre-Moslem) Egypt troubled me. &nbsp;(H.
once referred to "pagan" as part of a list of some kind, and I asked
which particular group was pagan... &nbsp;This probably didn't
endear me to anyone, either.) &nbsp;"Pagan" is, of course, a
disparaging comparison between a previous (false) religion and one's
own (or at least one's society's) current (true) set of
beliefs.&nbsp;Historically, I have the impression that Islam used
"infidel" in a similar spririt, and though Christianity has also
referred to Moslems as infidels, "pagan" seems to have been the term of
choice.&nbsp; (I haven't noticed whether Judaism has any tradition
of such terminalogy; my studies have focused on Christo-centric history
and especially Renaissance and Reformation Europe, when the relevance
of "pagan"--i.e., Greek and Roman--thought was a very touchy subject.)
&nbsp;Without wishing to disparage individuals who have a religious
faith (nearly everyone I know,&nbsp;whose personal virtue is
typically shaped by their religious beliefs), I distinguish between
individuals and religious institutions, which I&nbsp;find
historically riddled with unpalatable traditions and goals--especially
those categorized as "fundamentalist."&nbsp;(I say this with some
empathy for the commitment and sense of community, not the beliefs or
actions, of fundamentalists. &nbsp;For 3+ years, I once dated a
woman from a fundamentalist Christian background....) &nbsp;Any
distinction between polytheism and monotheism to buttress pagan vs.
"true" leaves me cold: I fail to see why the former is any less
superstitious than the latter. &nbsp;As an example: between
dynastic Egyptian belief in various gods and the Christians who defaced
their monuments, who was "pagan"?</p>
<p class="stblpara">In
Cairo we had cable TV in the hotel rooms. &nbsp;Essentially
useless:
U.S. programs had&nbsp;no obvious schedule, and they were reruns,
sometimes from years back, sometimes from the current season.
&nbsp;CNN
International and BBC World Service broadcast exceeded my worst
expectation about&nbsp;the emptiness of their
reporting. &nbsp;A current "critical" story (like the capture or
tracing of a U.S. ecoterrorist--I wasn't clear which) would get endless
coverage that
consisted almost entirely of raising issues that didn't exist and
talking about them at length. &nbsp;(I'm reminded of Daniel
Boorstin's
principle expressed a few decades ago of the pseudo-event,
a kind of unacknowledged conspiracy between the media and
publicity-seeking people or institutions to create a non-story and then
run with it.) &nbsp;I've seen similar crap on U.S. cable news
stations,
including CNN, but it rarely was as bad as what I saw routinely on
these
international news channels. &nbsp;Among its&nbsp;contributions
to a
culture of high pap, BBC had about as much&nbsp;sports reporting as
other news. &nbsp;The net effect of sporadically watching these
stations was to let me know what the stations' supervisors wanted
viewers to think was important.</p>
<p class="stblpara">I
experienced that curious phenomenon of&nbsp;service people with a
vested interest in the tasks they are trained to. &nbsp;On the Nile
cruise, for example, when I tried to serve myself at times, staff
would rush out and almost wrestle serving implements out of my
hand.&nbsp;It could be that they're trying to protect their jobs,
but I
doubt it. &nbsp;It is more plausible that they fear being caught
not
doing their jobs, but at least as likely I think is that <span style="font-style: italic;">they </span>develop
a need to have things done according to the rules of the class
they're&nbsp;serving. &nbsp;I found most service people
distantly
ingratiating.</p>
<p class="stblpara">The
cruise used the eco-scam I see everywhere I go now: save the
environment by not sending your used towels for washing. &nbsp;On
the
one hand, they then almost always provide towels barely good enough to
dry you from a
single shower. &nbsp;On the other hand, they themselves waste
energy by
the megawatt, as with&nbsp;all the unnecessary cutlery that
hoity-toity table-settings require or&nbsp;the empty posh stateroom
that had its AC on all the time.
&nbsp;The waste of food must have been humongous: the boat takes 40
or
42 passengers when full. &nbsp;We were 8 plus our guide. Lindblad
chartered it anyway. &nbsp;(I'm not sure they could have done anything
else, and for us passengers it was certainly luxurious to be so
uncrowded.) &nbsp;At each meal the amount of food seemed
enough for at
least 20 people. &nbsp;I can only hope that they distributed it to
needy people in the town where we docked, though it was probably so
rich that their stomachs wouldn't handle it.</p><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p style="font-style: italic;" class="stblpara">Brief background that may help give context to parts of my
account (or "5000 years in 6 paragraphs")</p>



<p class="stblpara"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> A single ruler united Upper (southern) and Lower (northern;
the Nile delta) Egypt about 3100BC.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pharaohs (= kings) ruled in about 30 dynasties (a dynasty = a related
group of rulers and might last from a few years to a few centuries).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Three divisions of ancient Egypt are
traditional, separated by 100-200 year periods of disunity and foreign rule:
Old Kingdom (about 1000 years), Middle Kingdom (400 years) and New Kingdom
(home rule for about 800 years and then 700 years of foreign pharaohs, mainly Persians
and Greeks).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last ruler was the
Cleopatra we know, though actually the 7<sup>th</sup> of her name, who ruled during
the Greek suzerainty, which started in 332 BC when Alexander the Great (after
whom Alexandria is named) conquered the country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style=""></span>The pyramids were built primarily not by slaves but by farmers
who had no work during periods when the Nile flooded. &nbsp;The
first pyramid, a variant on previous single-layer phaoronic tombs
called mastabas, was built about 2650BC (that is, 450 years
after Egypt&#8217;s unification), and all major pyramids were built within
the rule
of five successive pharaohs and all near Cairo, west (considered the direction of
the
afterlife) of the Nile; the three most famous are the 5<sup>th</sup> (the
largest, built by Kufu/Cheops), 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup>, grouped at
Giza to the southwest of central Cairo.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pyramid building continued through the Middle Kingdom, while New Kingdom
pharaohs shifted to building tombs that were dug into earth, the most famous
group of which is the Valley of the Kings near Luxor in Upper (southern)
Egypt.<span style=""> &nbsp;About 130 pyramids are known in modern Egypt, most of which are&nbsp;rubble--e.g.:.</span></p><span style=""><img style="width: 800px; height: 533px;" alt="pyramid as rubble" src="pyramid%20as%20rubble.JPG"> </span>

<br>Remnants of some mastabas:<br><img style="width: 800px; height: 533px;" alt="mastabas" src="mastabas.JPG"><p class="stblpara">Most (not all) of our knowledge of ancient Egypt is from hieroglyphs
(deciphered in modern times by a Frenchman in the first quarter or so of the 19<sup>th</sup>
century after discovery of the rosetta stone in 1799) at tombs and
temples&#8212;that is from information that rulers wanted people to
have, so that we need to be wary about what we trust&#8212; and a great deal of <span style="font-style: italic;">that </span>knowledge is about death and dying.<span style=""></span></p>

<p class="stblpara">The Nile flows south to north (when Egyptians in
the Middle
Kingdom invaded the Tigris-Euphrates area, they didn&#8217;t know how to
describe the
reverse flow of those rivers) and provided a path for transportation
(the current took boats north, reliable breezes took them south against the current) as
well as a source of agricultural fecundity. &nbsp;The well-being of the
nation was dependent
on sufficient (but not too much) flooding each year; famines were not
uncommon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this day &#8220;green&#8221; Egypt is
a narrow band on each side of the Nile, with desert expanses east and
west.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the 1960s Nasser had the Aswan
dam built; a number of western nations collaborated to rescue monuments that
would be flooded by the lake (Lake Nasser) that would be created once the dam
began operating.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dam&#8217;s great
virtues are that it regulates Nile flooding so Egypt is no longer at the mercy
of inconsistent flooding, and it is a major source of electricity generation;
its drawbacks include a degeneration in silt quality downstream and maybe some
adverse effects upstream.</p>

<p class="stblpara">The Roman and Byzantine Empires ran Egypt for 6
centuries
after Christ (whose parents are reputed to have hidden out with him for
awhile
in Egypt), during which time Coptic Christianity slowly flourished.
&nbsp;After that Persians briefly held sway and then, starting in 640,
Moslems.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A number of Moslem dynasties,
sometimes surrogates for external Moslem conquerors (most notably the Ottoman Empire
from 1517-1798) ruled until 1798, one of which (the Fatimids) founded Cairo in 969.</p>

<p class="stblpara">In 1798 Napoleon invaded Egypt without much success once the
British arrived to challenge him. Until 1952 and Nasser&#8217;s revolution, Egypt was
in general turmoil, sometimes ruled either by typically autocratic and corrupt
officials colluding with or undermined by Europeans, and by England
(1882-1952).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Suez Canal was built
under French guidance between 1854 and 1869.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p><i>HERE BEGINNETH THE DAY-BY-DAY ACCOUNT</i></p>
<p><i>Wednesday, April 8, 3:20 pm</i></p>
<p>Eearlier, we sat in the NYC apartment
trying to keep occupied.
&nbsp;Excited. &nbsp;Anticipatory. &nbsp;Nervous.
&nbsp;Now we're in the Delta
lounge at Kennedy. &nbsp;Check-in was easy only because (thanks to
mileage)
we're flying business class. &nbsp;The coach line was
long-long-long; and Delta
had only two agents on duty for everyone checking in&#8212;and one agent
started a
long phone call with a customer. &nbsp;Delta apparently has no
interest in
customer convenience once you've bought your ticket&#8212;unless you've
bought a
premium ticket. &nbsp; I found myself outraged for the people on
line, grateful
that we had business class.
</p>
<p>The gratitude was increased when we got to use the
special
lounge&#8212;quite, comfortable, wi-fi available, snacks and wine included.
</p>
<p> Our flight is supposed to board in 15 minutes.
&nbsp;I
continue to work on Arabic vocabulary and grammar--nervous about
whether I'll
get to use any of it, and if I do what I'll remember, and whether I'll
make any
sense. &nbsp;I have found very confusing the vocabulary differences
between
"classic" Arabic and Egyptian, and I've had many questions I would
have liked to ask a guide to the language. &nbsp;Still, I'm
satisfied with what
I've learned in the sense that I'm not going crazy about what I keep
forgetting
or who much I still don't know.
</p>
<p>We both find it hard to believe we're really going.
&nbsp;I'll take an ambien (sleeping pill) this evening and hope I
get a good enough night's
sleep on the plane to fool my body into thinking it's more or less on
Cairo time when we
arrive there at 9:30 am. &nbsp;We have the whole day to ourselves;
it will
be nice if we can use it to do some touring rather than catching up on
sleep.
</p>
<p>My current ipod book is on the history of Alexandria,
which
I hope will add an angle on Egyptian history to what I've so far read
or
listened to. &nbsp;I'm about ready to re-listen to Barbara Mertz's
history of
Egypt, which I found pleasantly sceptical and cynical as well as
comprehensive.
&nbsp;I forget so much....</p>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><i>Thursday, April 9, </i><i>noon
Cairo time </i></p>
<p>Largely uneventful flight, almost 10 1/2 hours.
&nbsp;Business class had tons of legroom, and the seat straightened
to maybe
135 degrees, but although flying overnight and taking a full dose of
ambien, I
couldn't sleep until&nbsp; a couple of hours before they woke us
for
"breakfast."
</p>
<p>Getting through passport control was slow buy easy, as
was
customs. &nbsp;Four of our six other passengers were on the same
flight, and we
met them at the airport when Lindblad personnel picked us up.
&nbsp;As usual,
we did not warm to our fellow-travelers, at least for the nonce.
</p>
<p>Our hotel, the Four Seasons (adjacent to the east bank
of te Nile on one side, the Cairo zoo on the opposite side) feels
like a 19th-century colonial residence with a few 21st-century
accoutrements
(like modern plumbing). &nbsp;Alas, when we finally reached there
after a slow
van ride from the airport (traffic is about as dense as one is led to
expect)
Maxine and I were both exhausted (though she slept a lot longer on the
plane
than I). &nbsp;I soon lay down and was out for three hours.
&nbsp;Maxine napped
some and then went to the pool deck, which seemed spacious and pleasant
when I
visited her there.
</p>
<p>Midnight: slept for a few hours, have taken an ambien
and
am catching up on this journal while waiting to conk out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For reasons beyond my ken,
my cursor on this
laptop keeps jumping elsewhere on the page (or even to another window);
it
never did this before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>We took a short late-afternnoon walk in the area&#8212;over to
the
Nile and along it for a few blocks.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We
were warned that you take your life in your hands when you cross a
Cairo
street, but my NYC technique (hardly original to me, I&#8217;m sure) worked
fine:
waiting for enough distance for a car to brake (the traffic is too
heavy for
anyone to weave quickly) and then stepping into traffic with
outstretched palm
towards the nearest oncoming driver.
</p>
<p>The Nile here is crammed with large
restaurants and other tourist boats reminiscent in size and shape of
Mississippi
paddlewheelers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
boat tried to look
as if all its outside walls had hieroglyphs, but as far as I could tell
they
were merely a few faux-hieroglyph shapes in a repeating pattern.
&nbsp;(NOTE: I have read that "hieroglyphic" is only an adjective,
and the noun is "hieroglyph.")
</p>
<p>Few women were on the street, and most of them were
either
in groups (perhaps wearing scarves, perhaps not, usually young) or, if
alone,
in versions of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>elaborate
burkas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One sole
woman sans burka strode confidently
along.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn&#8217;t
notice any men eyeing
her.</p>
<p>Alas, I had no money for baksheesh at first,
but did get to use my meager Arabic to say so.<span style="">
</span>&nbsp;At first opportunity, I withdrew money
from
an ATM, then asked at the hotel to change it into small bills.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had the impression from
guidebooks that a
single Egyption pound note would suffice (as our guide would later
confirm), but I asked to make sure and was
gently but firmly informed that would essentially be an insult&#8212;the
value was
too little.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So now
I will get a supply
of 5- and 10-pound notes to carry about.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I&#8217;ve always hated tipping, partly for purely selfish
reasons but partly
because we shouldn't live in an economy in which people are dependent
on the
whim and judgment of another person over whom they have little control.
</p>
<p>The infrastructure in our area is in considerable
decay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps
they're revamping the
lighting along the Nile, but a small thicket of wires (live?) protruded
from
the uneven pavement (often with gaps where cobblestones no longer lay)
every
several steps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Side
streets and many
buildings look in disrepair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
NYC
and Cairo mayors might&nbsp;have much to talk about on this score.</p>
<p>Connected to our hotel is an upscale mall
surely frequented only by those who look as if they have the kind of
money that
needs to be spent there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Profiling
is
alive and well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
enter the mall you must&nbsp;pass through a security gate and show
bags for
inspection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maxine
and I, however, were
waved through&#8212;even though&nbsp;the gate made a slight beep as I
passed
through it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing
there was of
interest&#8212;and probably everything there is also available on Fifth
Avenue.
</p>
<p>Too tired to investigate where to go for a good
restaurant. &nbsp;Our walk indicated none locally other than those
on the river, and we are warned&#8212;O those endless
warnings&#8212;that it is unwise for our good health to eat in neighborhood
restaurants or
from street carts (another avenue closed off for getting a sense of
everyday
Cairo life). &nbsp;So we had a very tasty dinner at a hotel
restaurant with a Lebanese
theme.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lamp chops,
shish kebab, stuffed
vine (grape?) leaves, crudites, bread&#8230;<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Multiple personnel served as at different times.<span style=""> &nbsp;Too much service.</span><span style=""> </span></p>
<p>Back in our room a little after 8, I soon lay down and
slept
until awakening and continuing this journal.
</p>
<p>It is too early in the trip to be sure, but I suspect
it&#8217;s not merely a
skewed data set that I have repeatedly experienced responses from
others that
seem to have little to do with questions asked&#8212;or even questions that I
had no
intention of asking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Lindblad rep
who met us at the airport spoke a good game of wanting to answer
questions and
be helpful, and he was ineed fine at his appointed job of getting us
through the
airport and to our hotel and into our rooms, but he seemed to have his
own
agenda about what information he would provide and not to answer
questions
directly (perhaps because he understood them, perhaps because he
didn&#8217;t&#8230;).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hotel and
restaurant staff seemed similar,
almost frighteningly polite and attentive even when you wanted to be
left
alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be
that their English, which
is fine as far as it goes, is limited and they're not comfortable
acknowledging
when they don&#8217;t understand something.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One especially unctuous member of the staff&#8212;a
manager of some
kind&#8212;assured (or seemed to assure) me that I would find free internet
service in the Lebanese
restaurant and the hotel&#8217;s business center.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I couldn't get a wireless connection at dinner,
he had someone come
who told me that none of this service is free&#8212;but then, when I looked
unhappy
at having been given misinformation, he entered a code
that&nbsp;would keep
me online for 24<span style="">&nbsp; </span>hours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Hence my feeling of
pressure to get as much
as possible recorded before dinnertime tomorrow night).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This same manager&nbsp;had offered strong
friendly
advice not to leave the hotel to walk along the Nile.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I imagine there is some feeling, perhaps reinforced
by actual
behavior, that tourists (just American tourists?) are incapable of
fending for
themselves without getting into trouble.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And perhaps there is also a psychology of
diminishing the chances of baksheesh
going somewhere else.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
doubt
sociological studies exist that&nbsp;address such possibilities.
</p>
<p>Tomorrow to the Cairo Museum,&nbsp;holder of the most Egytian
antiquities in the world but nonetheless shy of many accumulated in the
19<sup>th</sup>
century by museums in places like Paris, London, Berlin and New York.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Sharon Waxman, <i>Loot</i>,
provides a thoughtful, balanced look at the pros and cons of returning
previously &#8220;looted&#8221;
antiquities, <span style=""></span>like the Elgin
Marbles in
London or the Nefertiti statuette in Berlin, to their home countries.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
expect the tour to feel overwhelming, and I am optimistic that our
guide for
the rest of the trip, a trained Egyptologist, will both help us make
the most
of the visit and answer questions she is actually asked.
</p>
<p>A final note for today.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I am doing ok at reading Arabic signs, sometimes
even making some sense
of what they say, but I have understood no more than a scattered word
when
people talk in Arabic.
</p>
<p>1:30 am now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
have
to try to get back to sleep.</p>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Friday April 10
(incomplete--hurrying to post this before my internet connection is
gone...)</span>
<p class="MsoNormal">Slept so well that Maxine had
to wake me to get our day
started.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copious
breakfast buffet, and
at 10:30 first meeting with our guide.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She seems quite knowledgable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This introduction was about practical matters like
safety and money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(She
says leave one pound for baksheesh and
you don&#8217;t need to tip for most things.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I wish I could get standardized advice&#8212;one never
knows the agenda underlying advice.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">From there it was on to the
Egyptian Museum, a place for
which we received many guidebook warnings about lack of information on
exhibits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
good to have a guide, though far more exhibits
than I expected had brief identifying information.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The museum looks its age of&nbsp;100+ years but
I
suspect that is part of its charm.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The
collection is humongous and quickly overwhelming.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A replacement museum is being planned, and in theory
it will
catalogue and comment on the thousands and thousands of otherwise
anonymous&nbsp; items&nbsp;on display and
off.<span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I especially looked forward to
the Armana exhibits&#8212;the brief
(17 years) period when the cantankerous pharaoh Akhenaton ruled, in the
14<sup>th</sup> century B.C.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He is reputed to have tried the only stretch
of monotheism in ancient Egypt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
what draws me&nbsp;and others to the relics
of the period is the relatively modern art&#8212;a realism and
interest in nature that feels vibrant and committed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To my surprise, the exhibits here weren&#8217;t as copious
or varied as
those in New York&#8217;s Metropolitan Museum of Art.<span style="">&nbsp;</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>One set of tall,
complementary statues shows an elongated face
unfamiliar in the relatively formulaic images of most other pharaohs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also has a distended
stomach, which like
depictions of other pharaohs with seemingly distorted body parts has
been attributed
to a specific disease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(A
statue of one
pharaoh with disproportionately large legs has been assigned to
elephantiasis.)</p>
<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"></span>
<p class="MsoNormal">As I think happens to everyone
who views them, I never stop
marvelling at the preservation of much of the art of the "period," here
most
noticeable inside coffins.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
will see
much more of this phenomenon as we visit temples, pyramids and post-pyramid tombs.
&nbsp;I put
"period" in quotation &nbsp;marks because I have the strong sense
that
seeing a 3000-year stretch of any history as a continuous time of
little
change is as mistaken as treating U.S. history from the colonies to the
present as a relatively unchanging continuum.
&nbsp;Aside from frequent power struggles, occasional re-divisions
and
re-unitings of &nbsp;Upper and Lower Egypt, there were cultural
changes
(like burial customs,&nbsp;personal fashion, adoption of cultural
patterns from conquered and conquering peoples) and technological
inventions (like the water-pumping shadoof,&nbsp;in use until
recent years, introduced about
midway through the ancient dynasties).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Inevitably, I guess, the museum
(or at least the&nbsp;tour we took) stresses upper class ancient
Egypt in general, royalty in particular, and
death in even more particular.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
is
no different from my grade school history book, but I hoped for a more
subtle
treatment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our
knowledge of ancient Egypt is heavily
prejudiced, of course, by the allure of death monuments and royal
temples,
inscriptions for which reflect&nbsp;images their namesakes wished
to
present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Modern
Egyptologists seem able
to approach their subject with appropriate scepticism and critical
care, but
even the informed spiel of our guide is laced with assumptions and
predispositions
to present a favorable spin about what she relates.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I suppose the biggest problem I
have is widespread embrace
of Egypt as the first civilization, and a great one at that.<span style="">&nbsp; (Those are two different questions: what
is civilization? what makes one great?) &nbsp;</span>It may
be unfair to project modern values on
an ancient times, but I would think it&#8217;s at least fair to try to
describe it with relative dispassion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If
early societies really couldn't evolve other than as class-ridden with
resources flowing to the high-born while most
people had to settle for subsistence, we needn&#8217;t then go all gooey when
recounting how the high-born managed to fight off invaders or
conquer others (and enslave captives) or build great monuments to
themselves or create trade routes and infrastructures dependent on<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the suffering of most
people who toiled to
support the creations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judging
the
&#8220;success&#8221; and &#8220;failure&#8221; of rulers and societies should require some
careful
evaluation of the assumptions underlying those judgments.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Still, I enjoyed the museum
visit and did learn a fair
amount from our guide&#8217;s explanations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(I also found that&nbsp;my reading and listening
to
recordeded
books to prepare for this trip has been quite helpful.)<span style="">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="page-break-after: avoid;"><i><img style="width: 800px; height: 533px;" alt="pyramidsfrom4seasonsbalcony" src="pyramids%20from%204%20seasons%20balcony.jpg">This photo

<p class="MsoNormal">Tomorrow:&nbsp;Islamic
Cairo.</p>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p style="font-style: italic;" class="MsoNormal">Saturday
April 11</p>
<p class="stblpara">Tough day for me today: I was
exhausted and have some
intestinal problem, though not necessarily a bug.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although I fell asleep early (9pm?) I woke at
midnight, was up
for maybe an hour, and then woke at 4:30 and couldn't get back to sleep.</p>
<p class="stblpara">We had an early breakfast and
started our touring at 9am: The
Citadel (a 13<sup>th</sup>-century fortress inside Cairo),
an 1805 mosque built
within those walls by Mohammed Ali, and then the Ibn Tulun mosque, built
in the 9<sup>th</sup> century.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The 1805 version I found largely
unappealing&#8212;dirty, run down, minimal creativity (though it also seem to
be
undergoing major remodeling that will take a long time).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The much older mosque, still in use, felt far more
satisfying and harmonious.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Or am I just another American who responds, &#8220;older
is better&#8221;?) </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Some photos of the Mohammed Ali
mosque:</p>
<img style="width: 800px; height: 533px;" alt="m ali vendor" src="m%20ali%20mosque%20outdoor%20vendor.JPG"><span style="font-style: italic;">A few yards opposite the

<img style="width: 800px; height: 533px;" alt="mosque dome" src="new%20mosque%20dome%20impressive.JPG"><br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">I did like the

<span style="font-style: italic;">This
clock, now not working, was a present from France around the 1830s.
&nbsp;France and Britain were both busily trying to win favor and
power
in North Africa, in part for military reasons, in part to facilitate
trade and communication with India and the rest of Asia. &nbsp;(Is "military" vs. "trade"&nbsp;a false distinction?)<br>

<p class="stblpara">The two other men in the group, in their mid-late 70s, decided to climb the
stairs of the rather tall minaret at the
Ibn Tulun mosque (of which I have no photo). &nbsp;I could only
admire their intrepidity while lamenting the time this would take.
&nbsp;While waiting their return, I spent a good deal of time in
the street outside the mosque.
&nbsp;Later in the trip, they would happily, loudly and
triumphantly recall their ascent as they shouted back and forth about
new, daring treks they might take. &nbsp;</p>

environs:</p>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Notice the shop to
the left of the white plastic chair. &nbsp;This is a butcher's with
slabs of meet hanging in the open. &nbsp;When I tried to photograph
this close up, the proprieter yelled at me. &nbsp;I thought he was
just being persnickety, and I bowed and sarcastically said in Arabic,
"Thank you, thank you." &nbsp;H. later explained to me that recent
Egyptian law had banned such hanging of meat, and the proprieter
wouldn't want a pictorial record of his violation.</span><br>
<br>
<img style="width: 800px; height: 1137px;" alt="ibn tulun st butcher" src="ibn%20tulun%20street%203%20butcher.JPG"><br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">I cropped this
from another photo of the butcher's and expanded it. &nbsp;During
the rest of the trip I would notice the same violation in various
places.</span><br>
<p class="stblpara">H. took us to a special Egyptian
restaurant in the middle of
the main Khan el Khalili market area where, I believe, many tourists
were
gunned down in a 1997 attack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
area
itself, once a souk (bazaar, market) for Cairenes as well as visitors,
is now
entirely a tourist market.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
cannot
count how many times I said, &#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; in Arabic to accosting
vendors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;d had a
big breakfast, and I
wasn&#8217;t feeling well, so I had only a cup of tea at the restaurant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Though I wasn&#8217;t hungry, H. insisted on having a
lunch box
prepared for me to take to the hotel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="stblpara">I had toyed with skipping this
part of the day&#8217;s outing and
returning directly to the hotel, but lunch was not supposed to last&nbsp;long,
there would be only a 45-minute walk afterwards, and it seemed to me
that
though I was exhausted and sleepy, it was pointless to cut that short.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lunch, however, dragged on
and on, and
finally I decided I was so uncomfortable that I couldn't last any
longer for
touring.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I told
H. I wanted to catch
a cab.</p>
<p class="stblpara">H. was clearly not comfortable
with my finding a cab and
negotiating the fare myself with my highly limited Arabic, so she
walked me to
a nearby square.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
we walked back
through the souk, I realized I was hardly ever being accosted by
shopowners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
mentioned this, and we
speculated that perhaps the shopkeepers target (1) women and (2) men
accompanying women
(because those men will surely&nbsp;be susceptible to their female companions&#8217;
undoubted addiction to shopping).</p>
<p class="stblpara">The square at the edge of the
souk was flooded with cabs, all
seemingly in transit: technically, they were not supposed to stop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>H. addressed one driver,
hesitated, wasn&#8217;t
comfortable with him, then negotiated with a second driver and told me
to pay
30 pounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we
started to pull out,
she ran up and said to give him five pounds more to cover a bribe he
had to pay
to a cop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said,
only half-jokingly,
&#8220;Maybe you should write down the cab number just in case.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;I already did,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p class="stblpara">The taxi ride back to the hotel
was an experience all its
own&#8212;everything you might expect from reading the guidebooks about Cairo
driving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Actually,
aside from the
general proviso that traffic lights were optional, I&#8217;m not sure the
ride was
any more harrowing than it would have been, say, in Rome.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cutting in and out of
traffic with little
room to spare, the driver made <i>relatively</i> little
use of his brakes&#8212;by
which I mean he was pretty confident of what he was doing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="stblpara">The street layout felt like
Paris, major thoroughfares and
boulevards lined with storefronts and angling off from one another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most streets we took had several
lanes of traffic,
and most cabs (at least) had multiple bruises.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>H. would later tell me that touches that barely
damage the car are
ignored.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At one
point while we were in
the left lane of a 2-lane right-of-way, proceeding at maybe 30-40 mph,
I saw a
car (not cab) to our right in which the driver kept honking, and
although she
never made an effort to switch lanes, her left signal seemed
permanently
flashing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
wearing the religious
dress that leaves just face and hands showing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In her right fist, which moved like a programmed
automaton between resting on the
rim of the steering wheel and punching the horn every few seconds, she
gripped
what must have been a cell phone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her
other hand was in her lap.</p>
<p class="stblpara">From the back seat of the cab I
watched pedestrians singly
and in groups.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
crossed the wide
streets as anyone might in any large city with heavy traffic, sometimes
talking
on a cell phone, sometimes in conversation, seeming hardly needing to
look at
the traffic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet
their timing (and the
drivers&#8217;) was a perfect <i>pas de deux</i>: each paused at
different moments,
sensing I suppose when the other would or wouldn't have to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have no idea of the rate
of pedestrian
accidents in Cairo, but in my limited experience I wouldn't be
surprised to
learn it is minimal.</p>
<p class="stblpara">Perhaps because I wasn&#8217;t feeling
well, I was far less anxious
about the hectic ride than I would have expected (which doesn&#8217;t mean I didn&#8217;t have my
heart-sinking
moments), and I arrived safely at the hotel in due course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I flopped in bed with a
bottle of water near
at hand, alternatively listened to a book on my ipod, solved puzzles in
the
Herald-Tribune, and napped and napped and napped.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I couldn&#8217;t stop feeling tired.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When Maxine got back&#8212;and her return was much later
than I expected even
when I finally left the lunch restaurant&#8212;we consulted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I did not seem to be running a fever, and I
didn&#8217;t think my problem was more than jet-lag tiredness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I continued to have short
naps, 10-15
minutes, and that night I skipped the fancy-shmansy &#8220;welcome&#8221; dinner at
Le
Pacha 1901, a restaurant floating on the Nile.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I reassured Maxine I would be ok.</p>
<p class="stblpara">Around 7:30 I began to have
stomach cramps that would ease
only briefly and slightly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some
early
form of diarrhea added to my joy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I
groaned steadily, a common indulgence for me when I&#8217;m not feeling
well&#8212;it
releases pressure&#8212;and the one fringe benefit of Maxine&#8217;s not being in
the
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I started
fantasizing about
having to see a doctor, having blood drawn (or transfused?) or an IV
inserted
against dehydration, and I obsessed about how to get such medical care
that
wouldn't risk HIV contamination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
have ample travel medical insurance, but how to get it used correctly?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Phone the US embassy?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Call Lindblad?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The health insurance
policy issuer?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then
I worried about my moaning all night and keeping Maxine
up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maybe one of us
should get a separate
room?</p>
<p class="stblpara">I began to want Maxine
desperately to return, but I didn&#8217;t
want to interrupt the dinner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
2 ½
hrs I finally phoned H.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
had just
left the restaurant, but it was a half-hour away.</p>
<p class="stblpara">That night I started to take
Cipro and ibuprofen, included in
our pharmaceutical hope chest for the trip.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Each trip has taught us yet another medication to bring in future.) &nbsp;Perhaps just because of the comfort of having Maxine
there, I soon felt
much less pain and, having taken a full dose of ambien, was able to
relax and
fall asleep without much trouble after reading some pages on Coptic
Egypt
(tomorrow&#8217;s outing).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
awoke a couple
of times during the night, read more of these pages, and slept again.</p>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p class="stblpara"><i>Sunday, April 12</i></p>
<p class="stblpara">I was still pretty miserable and
tired in the morning, had no
interest in breakfast (though I did eat a little unbuttered bread and
had a cup
of cocoa), but decided to dress and get ready for the morning&#8217;s
excursion to
Coptic Cairo, promising myself I wouldn't go if I didn&#8217;t feel up to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knew I might be in
denial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we
waited for the van, I asked Maxine&#8217;s
advice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She of
course could give me
none.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just as we
were ready to leave, I
had a flash that I wasn&#8217;t up to this outing, and I returned to the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My greatest concern was
being able to fly
the next morning to Luxor and participate in the excursions to ancient
Egyptian
sites.</p>
<p class="stblpara">I napped a lot, intermittently.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Somewhere yesterday or
today I ate half an apple over a half hour
or so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn&#8217;t
recoil at the sight of
it, so I tried it; and it was good.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But
plenty.</p>
<p class="stblpara">(Incidentally, nausea was never
part of my symptoms&#8212;I just
felt repelled at the idea of <i>any </i>food.)</p>
<p class="stblpara">&#8220;Coptic&#8221; Cairo is perhaps a
misnomer; the coptic area is
within the oldest part of Cairo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since
Cairo wasn&#8217;t founded until 969 (by Fatimids from further west in North
Africa
who drove out the ruling house of just 34 years, the Ikhshidids) and
the Copts
were Egyptians in the early centuries after Christ, I suppose &#8220;Coptic&#8221;
Cairo
must be a part of the city to which Copts migrated under Fatimid rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My main knowledge about
early Christian
Egypt is the profusion of monastaries and hermits, some who like Simon
of the
Desert stood atop tall pillars for years to demonstrate their sanctity.</p>
<p class="stblpara">Turns out that since this was
Palm Sunday the Coptic churches
weren&#8217;t in the tourist business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
the group visited other parts of the old city.</p>
<p class="stblpara">Most of my Sunday was bedridden
with frequent naps, solving
of puzzles, and a bit of ipod listening to the book on Alexandria.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At 4:30 I stirred myself
to attend a lecture
by a Cairo University Egyptologist, M.A. Nur El-Din, originally
scheduled for
yesterday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
introduced myself and
warned him I might have to leave during the talk.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I said this partly as a cover if I didn&#8217;t like the
lecture, and
after 45 minutes I did leave, indeed feeling a bit sick but frustrated by
the
lecturer&#8217;s manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
adopted an
informal, chatty pose which he used as a waystation to an imprecise and
overly
personal lecture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like
other
Egyptolgoists I have encountered, he felt it necessary to do a riff on
the
nonsense of the aliens-built-the-pyramids claim, and he made several
ironic
references to the failure of Western nations to return cultural items
looted
from Egypt, including the Rosetta Stone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Having read Sharon Waxman&#8217;s account, I knew that
while his core claim was
fair (and before reading her I assumed it was <i>the </i>right
claim), I now
knew that matters were more complex.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It
wasn&#8217;t his claim that annoyed me but his failure to include a nuanced
critique.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is,
after all, an
academic.</p>
<p class="stblpara"><i>[Friday, April 17: I&#8217;m
writing much of this day&#8217;s account
on Friday as I catch up with material I haven&#8217;t had time to record
since being
sick, and as I have thought more about this issue, I have decided that
the lack
of nuance is not so much academic laziness (though it may be that, too)
but a
different academic focus from mine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just
as
medieval artists could ignore physical perspective when painting
Madonna and
child because the moral perspective was more important (let&#8217;s put aside
the
issue that three-dimensional perspective had been lost), or as during a
disaster a normally thoughtful person might ignore nuances and form a
quick judgment about how best
to weather the immediate crisis, so an Egyptian Egyptologist may be
more
concerned with righting perceived injustices than covering all the pros
and
cons of the looted-antiquities arguments&#8212;doing which would only
distract from
the true goal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
will also note that
for everyone else on the tour, the lecturer probably pitched his
material at
just the right level.]</i></p>
<p class="stblpara">Aside from this minor issue I
was frustrated by a talk full
of interesting topics but lacking&nbsp;much detail, so I played my
illness card
and quietly left the lecture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maxine
and I went for a light dinner (I had half a bowl of pasta and tomato
sauce),
and we tried to go to sleep early.</p>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p class="stblpara"><i>Monday, April 13</i></p>
<p class="stblpara">Southward ho!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But not
in comfort.</p>
<p class="stblpara">We learned a few days ago that
because our group is so small,
Lindblad would forego the promised private air transport to and around
Upper
(southern) Egypt, and we would instead fly Air Egypt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, Lindblad was still leasing the
entire Nile
cruise boat, Triton, which holds 40 passengers, for just us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps had I not been
sick I would have
viewed this as, &#8220;you lose some, you win some,&#8221; and perhaps had I not
been
recovering from illness and also disgruntled about a couple of our
companions
who seemed non-consciously bent on hi-jacking the trip, I wouldn't have
minded
the prospect of less comfortable travel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But in plunking down premium bucks for luxury which
I would normally
repudiate, I felt aggrieved that I would have to go through the usual
airport
procedures and crowds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(We
asked why
Lindblad wouldn't hire a small plane and were told the smallest would
be for 45
people, far too many.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
wonder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps the
small planes Maxine and I took
10 years ago in the African bush are not available in Egypt or for such
distances.)</p>




<p class="stblpara">Did I mention that because we
were taking the commercial
flight, and to get our Upper Egypt touring in sync, we had to get up at
4:30am?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The gentle
reader may
conjecture about how <i>that</i> affected my mood.</p><p class="stblpara">We got through it all and arrived at Luxor airport, from
where, while our bags were being ferried to our riverboat rooms, we took a van
to Karnak, a large temple complex affiliated with the Valley of the Kings
(which we visit tomorrow).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We began at
a visitor&#8217;s center with a wonderful model of the Valley: the hills were
recreated in a thin white muslin-like substance (for all I know, it was
muslin), and beneath, attached to the corresponding tomb entrances on one side, were scale
models of all the tombs below ground, with their chambers and tunnels. &nbsp;I took photos to try to give a sense of the model,
but they don't do justice to it. &nbsp;For one thing,&nbsp;for some
reason I only photographed the underside (the replication of
underground tomb chambers) of the model and not the top (the outside,
valley view of entrances to the tombs), which you would see if I could
rotate the photos&nbsp;180 degrees along a vertical axis.</p><img style="width: 800px; height: 533px;" alt="valley of kings model full" src="valley%20of%20kings%20model%202.JPG"><span style="font-style: italic;">The
upper, white part of the photo that resembles an oyster is supposed to
be the INSIDE of the valley; the metal protuberances beneath that are
small models of tomb chambers and their connecting tunnels. &nbsp;If
you could see the other side, you would see that where these chambers
disappear into the white of the valley, they come out on the other side
as tomb entrances.</span> &nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">The perpendicular metal bar a
third of the way from the left is a support for the model. &nbsp;The
door in the upper left leads out to Karnak, a couple of hundred yards
away.</span><br><img style="width: 800px; height: 364px;" alt="valley of kings model crop left" src="valley%20of%20kings%20model%202%20crop%20right.JPG"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>

<br><i>This is a closeup of the tomb chambers-and-tunnels on the
right of the previous photo.</i> &nbsp;<i>It's a little easier here to see that
the different tombs are at different angles to the surface of the valley, and
some are longer than others.<o:p></o:p></i><br><p class="stblpara">When I
looked up from snapping these pictures, I could see no one in our group.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The room was not large, maybe 40-50 feet on each wall, and I kept
looking around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went outside and saw
no one there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From here you walked to
Karnak several dozen yards away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
looked that way and could spot no one.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I went inside and outside a few times, wondering if the group had gone
ahead, and finally deciding it must have, though I couldn't imagine how Maxine
wouldn't have noticed my absence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
the only explanation seemed that this is what happened, and that by the time
anyone noticed I was missing they agreed I would catch up with them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So after a few more in-and-out looks, I
headed for the temple.</p>

<p class="stblpara">Inside, I couldn't enjoy what I was seeing because I felt I
must find the group, and that anyway without H.&#8217;s guidance I had no idea what I
was looking at.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I covered most of the
tomb&#8217;s area (it is quite large) and feared we might have crossed paths when,
after a half hour or more of this, I saw them coming down the main avenue from
the entrance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had been waiting for
me, had searched for me elsewhere, and Maxine had finally persuaded H. to
proceed to the temple.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was angry with
them; they were surely angry with me for having wasted so much of their
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt I had made the sensible
choice&#8212;though I had remembered that the best strategy for two people (or
groups) to find each other is for one to remain in one place; I just hadn&#8217;t
wanted to wait for them to come back from the temple to the visitors&#8217; center&#8230;.</p>

<p class="stblpara">I was pleased to find that all this effort did not exhaust
me, though I was certainly tired by the end of the day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My illness seemed to be under control.</p>



<p class="stblpara">We had our outdoor buffet lunch on the boat and then went to
the Luxor Museum, a small and lovely modern display of miscellaneous ancient
items including a couple of pharaonic mummies.<span style="">&nbsp;</span><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;</p>

<p class="stblpara"><i>Tuesday, April 14</i></p>

<p class="stblpara">This was a truly grueling day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The temperature was unusually high&#8212;over 100F much of the
day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our first and longest outing was
to the Valley of the Kings, the site of New Kingdom royal tombs (modelled at
the Karnak Visitors&#8217; Center) for its first several centuries (c. 1500-1100BC).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These were not pyramids but elaborate tombs
built into the the walls of a stony desert valley.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When you buy a ticket, it includes access to three of the tombs
that are open that day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I took it upon
myself to visit the tomb of Tutmosis III, &#8220;famous&#8221; for having been a &#8220;great&#8221;
warrior and significantly expanding Egypt&#8217;s control of lands well into Nubia in
the south and southeastern Ottoman lands in thenorth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This visit required ascending many stairs outside the tomb and
then descending (and ascending) roughly the same number of stairs inside the
tomb. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The temperature outside was 100F
and above; as you descended inside, the temperature steadily increased until it
must have been 120 or 130 at the bottommost level.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The drawings were relatively &#8220;primitive&#8221;&#8212;that is, closer to stick
figures than the fully developed depictions of people and gods we associate
with ancient Egyptian art.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the
bottommost room, I am accosted by someone who is supposed to be a guard who
hand-signs an offer to take my photo here.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Photographs are forbidden inside these tombs as they are in many places
but not in all.)</p>



<p class="stblpara">The antiquities services are trying too upgrade the ancient
sites tomb by tomb.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->Here the wall
paintings, still often vivid with original colors, have plasticene coverings
(presumably to protect them from guards&#8217; inviting fingers as well as tourist

learning nothing I couldn't tell them&#8230;).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="stblpara">The typifying features are the horns on her head and the flat
sphere&#8212;the sun disk&#8212;between them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
is a Greco-Roman temple, and I found myself thinking, &#8220;how recent, how
boring.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ah the relativism of
antiquity!</p>

<p class="stblpara">It was in fact pleasant enough, and I got myself
to&nbsp;crawl&nbsp;into a crypt (I went through the&nbsp;three-foot
opening backwards
on hands and knees), but I found myself beginning to think (or to think
further) that this trip is losing any purpose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is becoming a checklist of places-to-see-if-you-visit-Egypt, and we
are relentlessly checking them off.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Maxine feels similarly: we don&#8217;t need to see every shrine and tomb but
rather to have a theme that links them in some way that increases our
understanding of life, or something like that.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></p>

<p class="stblpara">This is most true with the dominant concern of the trip:
ancient Egypt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s the difference
between writing a summary and a critical statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knew when I boned up before the trip that much would be
repeated, but I expected my prior knowledge to ease my learning of new
things&#8212;and to provide a base for some interesting synthetic statements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="stblpara">We keep getting &#8220;facts&#8221; and little interpretation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we get interpretation, it is relatively
simplified and often not linked with other interpretations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The problem is colored by the heavy emphasis
on royal death rituals and religion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
many ways, a trip like this is a &#8220;fact&#8221;-enriched (with an enormous amount of such information) version of the most familiar,
cliché-ridden Western account of ancient Egypt.</p>

<p class="stblpara">This is probably a result of market pressures (or
rather, how companies perceive market pressures) to have tour companies
appear not to slight popular images of a tourist locale like Egypt.
&nbsp;People may sign up with&nbsp;expectations based on what they
already think they know, and may complain if those expectations aren't
met. &nbsp;So the (perhaps even unconscious) goal may be to make people
feel they are getting a far deeper understanding of what they already
know rather than an entirely fresh look at the body of knowledge.</p><p class="stblpara">The temple visit lasted a couple of hours and we returned to
the Triton to sail leisurely back to Luxor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The weather today has been wonderful, and I have been sitting
outdoors&#8212;continuing with <i>Occidentalism</i> and writing this journal entry and
catching up on earlier ones.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I wrote the above
summary of our Dendera visit, I saw children playing at the edge of the Nile, a
hundred yards or less away, and lifting my hands from the computer keyboard, I
snapped some telephoto pictures of them and a man washing his galibeeyah.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Children are especially prone to look at our
boat, wave and call to us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had the
thought yesterday as we sailed downstream and I saw children on the bank of how
physically close we were and how unbridgeable our lives are&#8212;nothing profound,
but especially forceful in the moment, weighted more by the chasm between our
personal futures (though they should outlive me) than by our cultures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This cruise could, I suppose, be a live
Disney event: the relative safety and serenity and insulation from reality of
the expensive tourist boat passing for hours between picturesque riverbanks of
palm trees, houses and shacks, laundry laid out to dry, people bathing and boating and cleaning
household equipment, farmland, minarets, power lines, at least one sugar mill
with belching chimneys, distant cars, an occasional sugar cane-toting camel,
garbage-strewn embankments&#8230;<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="stblpara">Maybe better than the Disney image: we&#8217;re like gods floating
through our holdings, gazing at and being gazed at by our subjects.</p>

<p class="stblpara">The afternoon was quite glorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We docked again at Luxor just before 6 and spent an hour+
visiting the Luxor Temple, built first by Amenhotep III (father of Akhenaton)
and then much expanded by Ramses II 150 or so years later, and now in the midst of the city the way
ruins are in Rome.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In recent years an
avenue bordered by small sphinxes (on pedastals perhaps a tall person&#8217;s height)
was discovered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It currently ends after
100 yards, where the city continues.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But as it has done with houses (hovels by western standards) around ancient sites that
may sit atop ancient ruins, the government plans to tear down intervening
buildings in hopes of finding the rest of a colossal avenue leading to Karnak,
2 ½ miles away.</p>

<p class="stblpara">Up at 6:30 again, off at 7:30 to the Valley of the Queens and
the Ramesseum, the remnants of a large self-laudatory temple ordered up by
Rameses II, who seems to have had a big ego even for an Egyptian pharaoh.</p>


<p class="stblpara">As I understand it, ancient Egypt had no position of &#8220;queen&#8221;
but rather royal or first wife, so I suspect the title is a modern one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is really a valley of tombs for pharaonic
wives and children, and the three open tombs (most tombs excavated so far have
been determined to be empty) today were of two princes and one wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the princes was actually a 6-month miscarried
foetus, and it is now preserved in a small glass-enclosed case in dim light
within its tomb of a couple of rooms.</p><p class="stblpara">MORE TO BE POSTED FOR THIS DAY</p>

<p class="stblpara">This morning we awoke at 7 and visited the Horus temple at
Edfu&#8212;the one linked with the Temple of Hathor that we visited two days
ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many interesting details, and I
began to get some sense how such places might keep getting built over time as
pharaohs kicked the bucket: according to Hebbe a new temple had a master plan
but when a pharaoh died before its completion, the next pharaoh would review
(and alter as desired) the plans and make sure <i>his </i>carouche appeared for
all pharaonic mages from then on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
images themselves were apparently interchangeable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This at least was the case by the time of this temple, started
under later </p>

<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"></span>

<p class="stblpara">One passenger commented&nbsp;that the
Egyptians must have been a deeply pious people to build these wonderful monuments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
probably believes medieval cathedrals
were pious expenditures supported by all. &nbsp;Is it the case that the
further back we look in time, the more we are prone to take things at
face value rather than look more deeply? &nbsp;If so, why does
remoteness offer that escape?</p>
<p class="stblpara">H. says many Nile boats have final-night parties where men
come in galibeeyahs and women as belly dancers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One passenger wished we would do that.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>H. said, bless her, that this Lindblad program is more sedate.</p>



<p class="stblpara">Because the Christian crew members are leaving later for
Easter celebrations, the ship had its &#8220;gala&#8221; dinner tonight instead of
tomorrow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of a menu of courses,
it was a sequence of single items over which you had no choice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Presentation, as ever, was elaborate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The food was ok.</p><p class="stblpara">MORE TO BE POSTED FOR THIS DAY</p>

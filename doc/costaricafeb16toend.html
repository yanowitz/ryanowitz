<p class="MsoBodyText2"><span style="font-style: italic;">After saying our goodbyes to Luna Lodge and Osa, we will
depart in the morning for the long ride back to San Jose. (If you would prefer
to fly back to San Jose, flights are available at about $100 p.p.)&nbsp; The rest of us will enjoy the spectacular
scenery, perhaps stopping along the way for an impromptu adventure. Overnight
in Dominical, Rio Mar or similar</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Slept through the night. Awake at 6 a.m., maybe doze a
little more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Breakfast is a pancake,
thick, mediocre.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I lie in a hammock and start recording many thoughts on my
tiny tape recorder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I finish Coates&#8217;
book about 9:15&#8212;very provocative.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Maxine and I discuss future trips in light of this experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Through lunch we all debate how to change
our travel plans.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am clear about our
options, but the others seem confused, and I&#8217;m irritated that they don&#8217;t seem
able (willing?) to heed me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
everything is decided I feel edgy; maybe I have some cabin fever.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Lunch is another salad bar with decent quiche.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 2:30 we go to a lagoon for
kayaking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tell the driver who takes
us to the lagoon that I cannot get the seat belt to work for me, and he says,
&#8220;You don&#8217;t need it.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We park on the
side of the road and walk down a steep decline to the lagoon&#8212;not a hard
walk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The kayaks are dumpy looking and
dirty inside, and our guide, Oscar, splashes them out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The lagoon is shallow and has some waves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have heard that there are crocodiles here
though we do not see any.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When is ask
what would happen if we capsize, Oscar says something to the effect that the
crocodiles would come for us, but I can&#8217;t be sure he&#8217;s serious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">He says we will have an hour and a half trip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first part seems easy, and I think,
&#8220;Aha, still water is much easier kayaking than the sea.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For awhile, maybe 40 minutes, I drift or
paddle slowly and enjoy the leisure and looking around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I see a couple of macaws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I find I don&#8217;t mind not having the camera
but actually enjoy looking at the scenery without its mediation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Oscar rows ahead of us and we cannot hear him when he
speaks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I feel tired and call to Maxine
that I'm going back but she and Oscar should continue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reverse trip is excruciating.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later I think there is a current, and I am
told that I am fighting the winds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
becomes painful to move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With much
effort I reach and pass a fallen tree that I think is near our starting
point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It isn't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At some point I shove the paddle straight
down, into the bottom of the lagoon, thinking I can pole my way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the bottom is a silty and traps the oar
for a moment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I almost capsize.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can&#8217;t row anymore, and in defeat or to
wait while I gain strength, I lean forward and let my head droop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Oscar sees I&#8217;m in trouble, rows to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I see I have drifted back to where I began
struggling several minutes ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has
a knife similar to a bowie knife, with a leather cord a few feet long, and he
ties one end to the front of my kayak.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(He says that he would normally have a rope with him that would work
much better.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He slowly rows us
forward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I keep trying to paddle, then
resting in exhaustion; I doubt I&#8217;m any help.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Back at the lodge I shower and feel better but a bit
inadequate<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&#8220;I&#8217;m not ashamed,&#8221; I claim
to Maxine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Using my headlamp in the
dusky light, wanting not to be sociable, I read at the dining<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>table before dinner, as usual.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dry chicken again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
listen to annoying interchanges about the hotel arrangement in San Jose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I find Oscar and give him $10, hug A and M,
who are leaving, shake Gary&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I want to be home immediately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next 48 hours of travel facing us feel endless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remind myself that the time will pass. In
the background I worry whether we&#8217;ll crash in the puddlejumper we&#8217;re going to
fly to San Jose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So much I want to be
gone&#8212;Maxine too&#8212;and not face another night under the netting.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">At 8 we leave off the lights inside our room and read on the
porch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I get antsy, feel at the end of
my tether, do puzzles, read.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I keep
wanting to go too bed, but it&#8217;s too early.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In bed<span style="">&nbsp; </span>at 9:45.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I read, am unable to sleep for a long time
while my mind races, then sleep fitfully, get up once to pee, have troubled
dreams.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am up for good around
5:30.<span style="">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Feb 17, Friday</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Over the next couple of weeks, I had the following e-mail
exchange with Josh, copying others in the group who were affected by the events
described.</p>

<p class="stblcolhdr" style="page-break-after: auto;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Me to Josh:</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="MsoNormal">You may already have heard about this from B and/or S.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="MsoNormal">Our original trip payment to you included a road trip from
Luna back to Porto Jimenez to meet the bus for the return ride to San
Jose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under normal circumstances, we
all understood that anyone who decided to stay an extra night at Luna would
have to pay separately ($70) for that trip at a later time. Of course, when you
knew we were ALL spending an extra night at Luna, you canceled the original
Thursday Luna-to-PJ drive.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="MsoNormal">You probably know that A, M and G got back to PJ via the
puddlejumper from Luna.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="MsoNormal">Hence, B, S, Maxine and I took the road trip on Friday
morning in place of the originally scheduled Thurs. trip. (We had moved our
Friday departure time up and paid a $10 airline fee for the change.)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="MsoNormal">Of course, we assumed that when you called Luna from our bus
before you left us and arranged our extra Luna time + the PJ-San Jose flight,
you had also shifted Thursday's original $70 trip to Fri.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="MsoNormal">However, when our driver got to the PJ airport on Friday
morning, he asked for $100 payment. We were very confused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To make sure he didn't somehow get stiffed
(on the possibility that you hadn't yet arranged for his payment), after
insisting that we were told the trip should cost $70 (which we later re-confirmed
with Luna's owner), we agreed to pay him the $70 and get reimbursed by you
after we returned home.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="MsoNormal">So...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We need you to
sort out whatever really happened between you and the driver, and in the
meantime reimburse Maxine and me $35, Sephanie and Barbara $17.50 each.<br>
Please let us all know when you will be mailing these checks.<br>
Thanks.</p>

<p class="stblcolhdr" style="page-break-after: auto;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Josh to me:</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi Richard,</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I apologize for the confusion. Normally when people purchase
services that are above and beyond what is provided, there isn&#8217;t a situation
like this where a part of the services are transferred, or even could be
transferred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was quite a unique
situation, and I appreciate your perspective on the matter. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Since you owe $90 that Koky paid for the additional tour you
took at Luna, I see no harm in discounting you the $35 and having you deduct it
from the $90. You can send the check to&#8230;:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I am happy to reimburse B and S the $17.50. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Warmly,</p>

<p class="stblcolhdr" style="page-break-after: auto;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Me to Josh:</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">At Luna, Koky informed us that because the all-day hike was
inappropriate for Maxine and me, we should take an alternative outing with no
extra cost to us; the only alternative that seemed suitable was the kayak trip
on the lagoon (which we wanted to do for only half the allotted time), and he
told us (with Lana [a Luna empee] standing there) that we could choose that if
we wanted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We then made arrangements
with Lana to do so--and indeed (as you know) she did not put the trip on our
bill.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Please don't drag this out further.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Please just send us the $35.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Thank you.</p>

<p class="stblcolhdr" style="page-break-after: auto;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Me to Josh after receiving e-mail
from B and S:</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Maxine and I are informed that you have now reimbursed B and
S.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We, however, have heard nothing from
you since my last e-mail reminding you that you authorized the kayak outing at
Luna at no cost to us, and we still have not received our $35.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We know you would not withhold the $35 because after the

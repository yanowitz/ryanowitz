<p class="stblpara">My first acting experience was in first grade at
the one-room schoolhouse I attended in South Jersey through&nbsp;third
grade. &nbsp;I was a sailor in a chorus line singing "Anchors Aweigh."
&nbsp;The other half-dozen or so kids had blue navy uniforms; all that
was left for me was a white uniform that helped inaugurate my lifelong
tradition of not fitting in....</p><p class="stblpara">My first "serious" role was as a senior in high school, playing the reporter in <span style="font-style: italic;">The Man Who Came to Dinner</span>.
&nbsp;I am sure that I auditioned for this only because I was trying to
emulate (and probably please) my father, who had been playing leads in
a variety of community theater (then called "Little Theater")
productions around South Jersey. &nbsp;(He writes about the <a href="meaculpa4.html">origin of his love for theater</a>
in his memoirs) &nbsp;I had little idea of what an actor needs to
do, but I gained at least one attitude from watching my father's
performances: to attempt to be as natural as possible. &nbsp;Over the
years, I learned a lot about what that actually meant (for instance,
it's more about being "real" than "natural") and how to achieve it. &nbsp;</p><p class="stblpara">Different actors can be effective with different techniques, but I think the following is a fair summary of what <span style="font-style: italic;">all </span>good acting (other than <span style="font-style: italic;">shtick</span>, which has its place) demands:*</p><p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="stblpara">The core of acting is <b><u>re</u></b>acting&#8212;listening,
engaging with what fellow actors say and do, and, within the context of your
character, responding from honest places in yourself that connect with what is
happening on stage.&nbsp; Ideally, a play should be fresh each performance&#8212;an
ensemble experience in which no role is completely fixed but in wc each performance shifts
a bit&nbsp;because there are slightly different energies, each player is
reacting in the moment, and actors keep making new discoveries within the
overall arcs of their characters and the play as rehearsed.&nbsp; A scene or beat hinges on
an intention that raises the stakes for one's character, and there is no single
legitimate line reading.</p><p class="stblpara">I
don't pretend all actors, successful or not, subscribe to every detail
of this summary, but I do think that only the unusual actor, probably
born with uncommon intuitive powers that&nbsp;work on stage, will be
effective without them. &nbsp;They seem to me embedded in all acting
schools that gained currency in the 20th century--Stanislavsky, Michael
Chekhov, Meisner, the Actor's Studio, and so on, and I have been able
successfully to coach inexperienced actors in such a spirit.&nbsp; What
happens, alas,
with most aspiring actors who have little training (and often little
confidence) is that they resort during early rehearsals and line study
at home to trying to find the "right" line reading for all their lines
and to perform their roles in exactly the same way every time.
&nbsp;(Certainly this is how I started out, and it probably wasn't til
my thirties that I began to learn better.) &nbsp;Aside from the fact
that there is no single "correct" line reading (delivery will vary
according to intention, unique performance vibes, and maybe whether the
actor has an upset stomach), and aside from whatever artificial energy
an actor reproduces every performance, this approach produces bland
performances that lack energy. &nbsp;Especially in amateur
performances, an audience may still enjoy such ritualized behavior, but
whether they know it or not, they would enjoy the same
play more with freshness each performance.</p><p class="stblpara">In
all productions in which I've been involved, some of the actors have
had little or no training, and this can create&nbsp;major problems in
developing a convincing performance with an ensemble tone. &nbsp;The
key to success or failure here, it seems to me, is the attitude and
ability of the director. &nbsp; I&nbsp;still struggle with constructively managing
this problem&nbsp;when I work with a director who does not embrace
the principles I describe above. &nbsp;On the other hand, when working
with a director who does understand (and support) them, the rehearsal
and performance processes can be exhilarating.</p><p class="stblpara">My best experience was in 2004 as Willy Loman in <span style="font-style: italic;">Death of a&nbsp;Salesman</span> at the Ivoryton Playhouse in Connecticut.
&nbsp;Most of the cast was skilled and committed to making the play
work, and our director, Dave Conoway, despite little experience as a
director, understood and supported the kind of acting approach I cite
here while having the skills to manage me and the rest of the cast when
theoretical, temperamental or interpretive problems arose.</p><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p class="stblpara">*I
suspect the same principles apply to musicals, but I have been in only
a couple, many years ago, and I am not clear how much the rehearsal
process might differ.</p>

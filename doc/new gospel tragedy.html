hear about Zeke Parsons&#8217; little girl, how she smacked his face?<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">You ever hear of that, little girl
hitting her own daddy?&#8221;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was so drunk, he beat the
puppy he give her last week for her </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">birthday, and she
just hauled off and hit him so hard he fell down and stayed there.&#8221;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

have problems, too, Bobbie-Sue, if your Ralph drank the way </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">Zeke does.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lord, I don&#8217;t think
I&#8217;ve seen that man sober since that business with his </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">momma back when
he was what-sixteen? fifteen?&#8221;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

here yet, remember?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I hear folks
say that was a tragedy, sure enough, and maybe justice, too</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.&#8221;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">&#8220;I know just what
you mean.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can remember old Miz
Parsons putting on airs all </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">over the county, getting the first TV
anybody ever saw round these parts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">Used up all the insurance money from when her man got killed by that
saw broke </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">loose...&#8221;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">&#8220;My momma said if
he hadn&#8217;t been...&#8221;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">&#8220;...and ran wild
down at the mill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Him hardly cold in
the ground, house needs fixing, but there she was </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.55pt;">parading around town for days inviting everyone to gather on her lawn
Saturday evening </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">after the set was supposed to arrive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why she even mailed an invitation to old Miz
Boone, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">and they hadn&#8217;t spoken in near twenty years, my momma said.&#8221;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.55pt;">&#8220;Folks say she
invited Miz Boone just to show her up.&#8221;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">&#8220;That&#8217;s right.
Anyway, the day that television set arrived, the whole town knew, and </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">right after dinner, just about everyone was scootched all together on
Miz Parson&#8217;s front </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">lawn.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My momma wasn&#8217;t gonna let me go, but I screamed and hollered something
fierce, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">and finally my daddy says, better take her
than have her come screaming up to that house,</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> make fools of us.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">&#8220;We went there,
and up on her porch is this giant brown piece of furniture, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.55pt;">near big as a coffin, setting on top an old door Miz Parsons had laid
across two sawhorses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">was plugged into a great long extension cord run out the living room win</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">dow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Teeny-tiny screen in those
days, no more than 10,12 inches, but, my, they put it in a huge cabinet,
nothing like the twenty-one inch Sony we got in our living room now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sound supposed to come out some fuzzy cloth
either side of the picture tube.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>TV
came from Montgomery Wards all the way over to Beulahville, the truck late
because none of them delivery boys had been out this </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">way before and they took a wrong turn at Arthur Hodges&#8217; place.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">&#8220;I remember him,
died of a heart attack week after we move here&#8230;&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">&#8220;When it finally
arrives, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">Miz Parsons tells the boys to stick it up on
that door, and she makes sure she </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">doesn&#8217;t turn it on
even for herself til everybody shows up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Now there&#8217;s that great big box, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">everybody looking
up at it like it was some kind of preacher passing through to give </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">us the word
itself.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.55pt;">&#8220;Well, right before eight o&#8217;clock, Miz Parsons gets up from the rocking
chair she&#8217;s </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">sitting in next to the platform, and she
raises her hands high, that short white hair of hers </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">looking like some kind of halo.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She&#8217;s about to start speaking to the crowd when she looks round and
realizes something&#8217;s missing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So she
twists her head back toward the house and </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">calls, &#8216;Zeke! Zeke
Parsons, you get out here right now!&#8217;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And there comes Zeke out the </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">front door like
he&#8217;s been caught in the bushes with Maybelle Grimes again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">thinking,
Why isn&#8217;t that boy <i>proud?<span style="">&nbsp; </span></i>He
slouches down those porch steps and stands off to </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">one side while
he watches his momma.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">&#8220;Miz Parsons sees
he&#8217;s there and turns back to the crowd.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Almost like she&#8217;s teasing</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">, she says, &#8216;Guess
everyone who wanted to come must be here by now,&#8217; and we see her </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">eyes rise over us to the street.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Everybody&#8217;s head turns, and I hear my momma whisper to </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">my daddy, &#8216;I don&#8217;t believe it!&#8217;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whole crowd just </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">stares at Miz Boone coming towards
us, keeping to the dirt sidewalk in front of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You remember </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">how it
looked then, before the county got round to laying the concrete, three, four
years lat</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">er?&#8221;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.55pt;">&#8220;And never touched
it again in all...&#8221;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">&#8220;It had rained
cats and dogs that afternoon, too, so poor Miz Boone is standing </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">there with her long black skirt trailing in the mud because there wasn&#8217;t
any way she was go</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">ing to set foot on Miz Parsons&#8217;
property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pretty soon, Miz Parsons
realizes she &#8216;s not getting attention any more, so she raises her voice and
says, &#8216;Well neighbors, here comes the </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">First Television
Program Ever in the History of New Gospel!&#8217;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And she reaches up and </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">turns on the television, her not even
five feet tall and could hardly reach the knob, she set </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">that TV so high.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There&#8217;s a big
hush and time passes, but nothing happens.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>&#8216;Hey Mabel,&#8217; </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">my daddy calls, &#8216;looks like the
damned thing&#8217;s busted!&#8217;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8216;Now you watch
your swearing, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">Lucas Burns,&#8217; says Miz Parsons, &#8216;and don&#8217;t
you be so all-fired impatient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
here TV needs time to get started, get all that electricity circulating
everywhere it needs to go.&#8217;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">everybody laughs at my daddy, and I shrink down like I don&#8217;t belong to
these people I&#8217;m </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">standing next to.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">&#8220;And sure enough,
a couple of seconds later, light starts to spread over that screen. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">Everybody goes ooh and aah.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
there&#8217;s no picture, just lines and dots, flashing away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">More time goes
by.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And still the only thing coming out
of that set is these light patterns.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Miz Parsons reaches up and fiddles with a knob here and a knob there,
and now we can hear a lot of buzzing </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">and crackling
coming out of the fuzzy cloth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Miz
Parsons smiles at us like she just swallowed a cup of castor oil but she&#8217;s in
church, and says, &#8216;Now you all be patient out there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">Rome wasn&#8217;t built in a day, remember.&#8217;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But pretty soon, the crowd starts murmuring,
and I </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">see Miz Parsons getting all red in the face,
foot stomping on the porch </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">without making any noise, like it could shake that TV into
life.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">&#8220;Right about then,
we hear a soft kind of snort from back of the crowd, so soft </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">you can&#8217;t even be sure you really heard anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But everybody turns round again, and </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">there goes Miz Boone, dignified as can be even with mud sucking at her
shoes every step </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">she takes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her white hair is bobbing as though she&#8217;s keeping time to the hymn music
</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">on Sunday morning, and her little black purse is
flapping against her hip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I mean, you </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">knew she was just as smug as could be even though you couldn&#8217;t see one
bit of her face.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">&#8216;The whole crowd&#8217;s
watching Miz Boone, but something makes me turn, and I see </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">Miz Parsons, eyes flashing the way I used to imagine the devil&#8217;s would
if someone called </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She grabs her rocking chair and yanks it over alongside that TV and she
climbs up, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">the chair rocking back and forth and her
skinny arms waving in the air to keep her balance, and she gives a big kick to
get one leg up on the platform, and somehow it gets there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">up comes the other
leg, and those arms still waving like she&#8217;s some kind of puppet on a </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">string because the door she&#8217;s standing on is moving side-to-side and front-to-back
on them </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">sawhorses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But even while she&#8217;s keeping her balance, she&#8217;s reaching for the top of
the set </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">where there must&#8217;ve been a whole other bunch
of knobs to adjust the picture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
reaches out </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">one hand to grip that TV for balance while
the door keeps shaking, and I see her fin</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">gers on the other
hand turning one thing after another this way and that way, and she&#8217;s </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">cocking her head back to watch the screen and see if she&#8217;s making any
difference.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">&#8220;All of a sudden,
you hear a man&#8217;s voice booming out of the set, saying nothing </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">you can understand, and some face comes on the picture tube.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everybody turns to peer at </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">the porch again, and I sneak a look at the street where Miz Boone has
stopped in her tracks </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">but isn&#8217;t turning round.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I look back at Miz Parsons, and I see
her lift her arms above her head and start to shout &#8216;PRAISE THE...&#8217;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And just at that moment, that platform gives
</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.55pt;">way, and she&#8217;s falling over backward, arms stretching
out like she&#8217;s trying to float on water, and the TV falling with her, and </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">the impact so heavy the boards on the porch snap, and she goes right
out of sight, and the </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">TV, too.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">&#8220;Zeke leads the
rush up the stairs over to the hole.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
like to jump down there, but </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">a bunch of men grab hold of him
first.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I see this ring of faces up on
the porch staring down </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">into that hole and studying on
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then everybody starts shouting, and
people fetch axes, try to </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">chop through the top and sides of the
porch to reach her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My momma and daddy
and eve</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">rybody else rush forward to see if they can
help, but I just stay put, so I&#8217;m all alone on that lawn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I see all those axes, rising and falling,
Zeke swinging in there with the rest, and hear </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">the boards
splintering, and hear men cussing but nobody, not even Reverend Johnson, saying
anything about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, it seemed
like 20, 30 minutes, but must&#8217;ve been a whole lot </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">shorter, they make a hole in the side of the porch, and two boys, Tom
Hodsen owned the dry goods store and Freddy Jones worked for him, crawl
in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Zeke runs down </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">and tries to follow, but folks hold him back again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I edge forward and peek through a crack in
the crowd where I can see that the men under the porch are trying to pull that
monster TV out of the way because Miz Parsons is trapped underneath it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She&#8217;s not moving or saying anything so far
as I can tell, and these men are desperate because they can&#8217;t do anything with</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">out hurting her.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">&#8220;Suddenly I see
Zeke race round the house and come back carrying a couple </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">ropes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He dashes up the porch
and hands the ends round.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You look up
there and the men are </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">passing down rope, and then you look
down under the porch and you see the rope getting </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">looped round the TV, and you look up again and see the men heaving, and
you look down and </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">you see the set rise just far enough so the
two men there can slide Miz Parsons out from under </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">it.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">&#8220;They pull her out
the hole and onto the lawn, Zeke looking down over the porch </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">rail, straight above where she&#8217;s laying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Albert Williams leans over her mouth and says, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">&#8216;She&#8217;s still breathing.&#8217;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
listen some more and adds, &#8216;just barely though.&#8217;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Martha</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">, Albert&#8217;s wife, had had the good
sense to run down the street to fetch Doc Sloane, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">probably the only person in town not out on that lawn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">comes running up,
huffing and puffing with his spectacles bouncing up and down on his nose and
him holding his black bag in front so it keeps banging against that big belly,
and </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">he squats over her and does a lot of listening and
thumping, and then I see him shake his </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">head and signal to
Sam Carpenter who goes off to fetch something to put over her.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">&#8220;Just then, I feel
someone touch my shoulder, and I jump like it was the devil him</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">self.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turn, and who do I see
standing behind me, gripping onto me, but old Miz Boone!<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">She&#8217;s just staring
like a zombie at her dead sister.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
fingers keep squeezing my shoulder, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">but something makes
me stay quiet and just look at her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
didn&#8217;t exactly feel any pain; it </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">was more a kind of
pressure, made me feel important to this grown-up person, however </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">strange she might be, like I was that platform up on the porch only
solid and not about to </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">fall.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">&#8220;Miz Boone, she
just stands on the grass, that hand clutching my shoulder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her own </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">shoulders are
sagging like I never saw on that proud lady, and up behind her wire spectacles
I swear I see a tear come out and start to run down her face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then she jerks her </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">head like she&#8217;s waking from a long sleep, and she looks down at me and
sees what she&#8217;s do</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">ing to my shoulder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She pulls her hand away, then pats the shoulder a few times, like
you smooth out a blanket when you&#8217;re making a bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She reaches in that little black purse and </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">pulls out the daintiest handkerchief you ever did see, hardly bigger&#8217;n
her hand itself and </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">with a fancy &#8216;K&#8217; embroidered in one corner...&#8221;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.55pt;">&#8220;Her first name
was Katherine, neighbor told me one time.&#8221;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">&#8220;...and she dabs
it ever so gently at her cheek like she&#8217;s fixing her makeup instead of </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">wiping off that tear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then she
smiles at me, but a sad smile, like I&#8217;m some kind of long-lost friend she never
expects to see again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She pats my head
and turns and walks off that lawn, through the mud, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">down the street and out of sight.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I turn round, and I see everyone still looking at Miz Par</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">sons, now all covered up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only
thing Sam could find to put over her was in the Parsons&#8217; backyard shed who
knows how many years, a scuffed rug falling apart, and her so </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">tiny it&#8217;s like somebody just swept the floor and hid the dust under
there.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">&#8220;Up on the porch, I
see Zeke sneaking into the house all alone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Next time I see him </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">is at the funeral, and everybody could
tell he&#8217;d gotten hold of liquor somewhere.&#8221;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.55pt;">&#8220;Folks say he was
spying when his daddy...&#8221;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">&#8220;Almost fell into
the grave, he did, right in the middle of Reverend Johnson&#8217;s preaching.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a proper disgrace, kept the whole
town talking for days after.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span style="font-style: italic;">March 7, 2008</span><p class="MsoNormal">This past Sunday, I attended a group discussion,
sponsored by the New Haven Center for Independent Study (<a href="http://www.cistudy.org/">CIS</a>), <a href="http://www.cistudy.org/"><b style=""><span style=""></span></b></a>&#8220;Speech and Self -- a conversation by, about, and with people who operate in
more than one language.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Quite
clear that it was only a hypothesis, our host proposed that the language you
speak determines (or heavily influences) your personality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We must have had about two dozen people
present, and each spoke of her or his experience with multiple languages and
how it might affect them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I found the discussion fascinating, and while I am
unconvinced that the thesis for the day is valid, I find it has interesting
potential, and in any event I heard a number of provocative statements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here&#8217;s a summary of what I can remember from
different speakers:</p>

<ul><li>A native speaker of Russian for whom English has long been her
primary language found herself dreaming in Russian; when she woke up,
she found
herself making notes about the dream in Cyrillic.</li><li>A woman finds she dreams in German even though she doesn&#8217;t
understand it.</li><li>A filmmaker who has no foreign languages feels that film is a
second language for her, and that she does function differently when
directing as opposed to her non-work life.</li><li>One woman has a grandson bilingual in Norwegian and
English.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(His mother is
Norwegian.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The boy, maybe seven now,
seems instinctively to know which language to use with which audience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I&nbsp;wonder whether his intuition is more a
sense of knowing what most people speak, and knowing who in particular, like
his grandparents, speak Norwegian.)</li><li>A native Hindi speaker long in America dreams in English and
finds herself feeling strange when she visits India&#8212;that in a sense&nbsp;she <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span>&nbsp;a different person in each language.</li><li>Wanting to be able to understand French passages in English
novels, one woman chose French as the language to learn in school.</li><li>I noted that I chose French to study in high school&#8212;and never
had any doubt I would&#8212;because my parents used fractured French to exchange
thoughts that they didn&#8217;t want their three children to understand.</li><li>One woman studied French, lived in France and became adept in
it, then, moving to in Germany, learned German and became more comfortable with
it than she had been with French.</li><li>A dramaturge spoke of the tricky issues for her in helping
budding playwrights &#8220;translate&#8221; everyday speech onto stage&#8212;that is, as I
understood it, to filter daily language into what would be dramatically
effective.</li><li>One woman, a native French speaker but fluent in English,
found that she felt unable to speak to her parents in any language but French, even
though they understood English.</li><li>One
woman, a professor of French literature whose first
language is English, found that her ex-husband, also fluent in both
languages (but whose native language is French), would switch between
languages without
knowing it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For example, a French term
might get mixed into an English conversation, and he would switch to French.</li><li>The same woman commented that she is much nastier in
French&#8212;suggesting again that to some extent the language she is speaking drives her
personality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I wonder whether this&nbsp;phenomenon is parallel to&nbsp;why so many otherwise balanced people can get very nasty
when exchanging thoughts over the internet, especially when they don&#8217;t
personally know the person they're being nasty about: the medium produces a
feeling of freedom from conditioned norms of behavior.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the nastier-in-French case, perhaps
swearing, for example, in the second language, however well you know it, feels more
detached.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I certainly find that true when I
speak another language, though I do not have the fluency in any language that
this woman has in French.)</li><li>One woman commented that while most language is a left-brain
function, Japanese is right-brained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
one had an idea why this would be so, or how it may make Japanese language
usage different from left-brained-based languages.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her comment prompted my question of whether neurologists have
done any testing to compare multiple-language brain use with
single-language.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Are multiple languages
in different parts of the language center?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Intermixed?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Do neural
connections form between them, or between corresponding diction or grammar?</li><li>One woman offered a penetrating, class-based, observation
about bilingualism in schools<span style=""></span>.
&nbsp;Traditional powers-that-be, she said, and their anti-bilingualism
supporters often demand English-only classes because&nbsp;(they argue)
for &#8220;practical&#8221; ends&nbsp;such as finding work, kids should speak the
language of their country. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>I had often heard this, but then she pointed
out that such arguments are made only in relation to immigrants (Spanish being
the most common example) and similar English-deprived children whose families&nbsp;are
relatively poorly off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More affluent
families, perhaps adding a cultural tradition of valuing broad education for
themselves, commonly view it as enriching for<i> </i>their children to know more than one
language.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(This contrast may need to&nbsp;address&nbsp;nuances related to which language is your primary one,
but it opened an area of thought for me that I had not previously
considered&#8212;even as I, kind of intuitively, have supported bilingualism in
school.)</li><li>An unanswered question arose: what is going on when two
people speak a language common to their knowledge but different from either&#8217;s
native tongue?</li></ul>






























<p class="stblpara">I have always been fascinated with words and their power or
ineffectiveness.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One day I think they
have enormous power, the next day I think they have none.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My dissertation was on <a href="dissertation%20main%20page.html">Tudor attitudes towards
the power of language</a>
(and I often had the fantasy of attaching to the final page a pin and
deflated balloon etched with the thesis title, next to which would be
printed, "Inflate and puncture").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
have prided
myself on ever-evolving prowess in my speech and writing. &nbsp;I am
practically a language fascist and easily get upset about English misuse (even
moreso when I discover a misuse I've had for years without knowing
better).</p>

<p class="stblpara">When I spoke at the gathering&#8212; our host called on me first&#8212;I
mentioned only a couple of things, one of which was that while my French is
very good (and my only foreign language that is), I am not fluent in it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do decently when having an academic
discussion, relatively poorly when conversing about everyday matters loaded
with argot (slang)<span style="">, and </span>when
I watch a
subtitled French movie, the dialogue is typically too fast for me to
follow--though if I read the subtitles while listening to the dialogue
I can identify a
great deal that is left out of the subtitles.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I have always wished I were&nbsp;fluent in French, and when I lived in
Paris for six months in 1968-69 I certainly improved (though never to the point
of understanding French movies)<span style="">.&nbsp; </span>But I
have always felt frustrated that I would never master French nuances and wordplay the
way I can in English.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Long ago I
compared my facility with French, compared to English, to a watchmaker wearing gloves as he makes a delicate adjustment.</p>

<p class="stblpara">Once I finished my own comments at the gathering, I found that
listening to others&#8217; thoughts prompted&nbsp;more of my own&nbsp;memories:<span style=""></span></p>

<ul><li>Before visiting France (when I was 23), I learned most of my French in high
school, with a teacher who spoke only French in class.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have always believed this helped me
enormously in learning and retaining the language.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I recall that while taking the high school classes, when working in the
chicken coop I would sing pop sings but translate the words into French (often
with literalized <i>faux amis</i>, I knew, but I don&#8217;t think that was
important).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
have no memory of exactly
what I did with, say, Elvis lyrics like, &#8220;You ain&#8217;t nothing but a hound
dog&#8221; or
Bill Haley&#8217;s &#8220;See you later, alligator&#8221; (though of that I do remember
&#8220;bis
sp<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">ä</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"></span>ter, alligator,&#8221; presumably when I was in Germany in 1958).
&nbsp;When I was driving with friends to Quebec City during
college, the accent flummoxed me--though I do remember between Montreal
and Quebec City asking a farmer, "<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">O&#476;
est Québec</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"></span>?"
and receiving the reply,&nbsp;with a sweeping gesture towards the
horizon (and perhaps wry glint in the eye), "C'est tout&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Québec</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"></span>!"
&nbsp;I also remember on that trip giggling repetition among us
travelers of &nbsp;"Voulez-vous vous coucher avec moi?" (I think I
wondered why, for such a personal question, one wouldn't say, "Veux-tu
te coucher...") &nbsp;To the best of my recollection, this sentence
never got spoken during our visit.</li><li>In 1958, at 16, I spent a couple of months living with a German
family on an American Field Service exchange program.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I learned little German then, but I did apparently pick up something of a
Bavarian accent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In college in the
early 60s, I took two years of German, did not enjoy the classes, and learned very little.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(My clearest memory of those two years was
the day after election day, 1960, when the teacher was celebrating the victory
of JFK.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had trouble with declensions
and retaining vocabulary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Years later,
when I had to pass a timed German translation exam (in which we were allowed to
use dictionaries) as part of Berkeley English department Ph.D. requirements, I succeeded on my second try only
because I managed to be extremely fast in looking up words; I knew little of
the vocabulary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From time to time when
abroad I have encountered someone with whom German is our only common language,
and I have barely managed to make myself understood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand: when hitchhiking in Europe, maybe Germany
itself, a truck driver and I spoke German and he asked me if I were Norwegian.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have always treasured that memory.</li><li>I have learned smatterings of a few languages, sometimes for
travel purposes.<span style="">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Symbol;"></span><br>

</li></ul>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><p class="stblpara" style="margin-left: 13.5pt; text-indent: -13.5pt;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;">-<span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
a trip to
Russia in 1965, I taught myself the Cyrillic alphabet so I could sound
out words, and
sometimes I could figure them out (I remember a menu word at Moscow
Iniversity (into which I had sneaked) that sounded out to German
&#8220;Kartoffeln.&#8221;)&nbsp; <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara" style="margin-left: 13.5pt; text-indent: -13.5pt;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;">-<span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
have a few bits of Latin.&nbsp; When I first attended grad school in the
Berkeley
English department, Latin was required, and I despaired of learning it
well
enough to pass the same kind of exam I would pass in French and
German.&nbsp; I
attended a Latin class led by another grad student, but I couldn't get
across
my problem in judging how exactly to make sense of which words and
declensions
related to which; as I recall, the class leader dismissed this issue,
perhaps
because he wasn&#8217;t sure how to answer; I remember his suggesting
something like, "It's intuitive, can't be explained, you'll pick it up."&nbsp; When I returned to Berkeley
five years
later, Latin was no longer a requirement.&nbsp; But I wish I could read
it,
especially Renaissance Latin. &nbsp;Over the years I have learned to make
a little bit of sense out of Latin I've encountered.</p>

<p class="stblpara" style="margin-left: 13.5pt; text-indent: -13.5pt;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;">-<span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When I went to
Italy a dozen years ago, I taught myself&nbsp;enough Italian that I could understand much
of what was written on the front pages of Italian newspapers.&nbsp; When we
were checking out of one hotel, I was able to have a rudimentary argument about the
bill; among other things, when the clerk gradually raised his voice in
frustration over my not understanding something, I was able to point out to him
that speaking louder was not going to help me understand.</p>

<p class="stblpara" style="margin-left: 13.5pt; text-indent: -13.5pt;"><span style="font-family: Symbol;">-<span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>About ten
years ago I began reading extensively in history concerning European discovery
of the Americas, from roughly mid-15th century to maybe 1530, when
the European encounters were dominated by the Spanish and, to a lesser degree,
Portuguese.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I taught myself a bit of
Spanish, enough so that often I could make decent sense out of non-esoteric
written Spanish, and could often also compare a Spanish text (like Columbus&#8217;
journal) with its English translation to identify potentially problematic
words.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I expect to return to that
research, and I will be interested to see (a) what I remember and (b) how much
more Spanish I&#8217;m willing to learn.</p>
<o:p></o:p></div>
<ul><li><a href="bwfresnotolondon.html">Elsewhere on this site</a>, I recount my consternation, when
teaching in a London secondary school, with the profusion of the expression
&#8220;different to&#8221; rather than &#8220;different from.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For the 2 1/2 years I lived in London, however, I relished my &#8220;bilingualism&#8221;
in mastering British terminology&#8212;though I didn&#8217;t try to duplicate the accent,
much to my students&#8217; occasional amusement,&nbsp;as when I said&nbsp; &#8220;Mos-cow&#8221;
instead of &#8220;Mos-co.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I still retain
some British pronunciations, including &#8220;Mos-co&#8221; and
basil ("bah<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&#900;</span>-zil" with a short "a," much to my wife&#8217;s chagrin, which is&#8212;perversely, of course&#8212; part of why I
retain the British pronunciation).</li><li><a href="familyhy.html">As I discuss elsewhere</a>, I have French family, thanks to my
paternal uncle&#8217;s settling in Paris with his Parisian wife and giving me two
male cousins.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
cousins were raised
speaking both languages, but like the New York Lower East Side
first-generation of their father and his siblings, preferred the
language of their birth country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their spoken English is very good, written
English so-so (though I can always follow them), but their understanding is
excellent&#8212;especially, I have long suspected, when pronounced with a
Lower&nbsp;East Side accent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can go far with them in French, but when
I&#8217;m in France and I have something private to say to them in public, I&#8217;ll
typically turn to English.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A couple of
summers ago, Henry, my younger cousin, and I sat in a bar discussing very
complex, intimate matters in this way.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their mother, native Tunisian, speaks five languages: Arabic, French,
Hebrew, English and Italian.</li><li>Fifteen or twenty years ago, I encountered an Eastern European (Polish or Czech) who
told me that when he had recently returned home after 20 years in a foreign country (maybe
the US, maybe a European nation) he found the language enormously changed and
had some trouble understanding people.</li></ul>


















<p class="stblpara">So what do I make of the thesis that one&#8217;s language drives
one&#8217;s personality?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am sceptical but
not dismissive of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
am more
inclined to think that the influence is a cultural one, what the
language
represents to us psychologically, or the effect of being in or feeling related
to the corresponding&nbsp;geography at least as much as speaking or
reading the language&#8212;but then I&#8217;m not sure how different that re-positioning is from the original thesis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
do have vivid memories that when I have traveled to a foreign
country&#8212;and this is probably still true&#8212;I have felt liberated in some
ways, freed from everyday constraints.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
example is what I said above about
relishing my knowledge of much British usage when I lived in London,
and though
I am surely out of date with youthful slang I get a similar pleasure
now when
watching a British film or TV show and understanding specifically British
terms
and references (though I often have trouble following all of a dialect). &nbsp;I watch a lot of BBC America dramas. &nbsp;When I
visit London or Paris, I feel I am returning to second homes.</p>

<p class="stblpara">One reason I specifically enjoy being in England or on the
continent&#8212;and again, this may not contradict the opening
thesis of the CIS discussion&#8212;is that I feel much more politically at home there than in the
US.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here my leftish politics are
marginalized; there, even when attacked they are&nbsp;recognized as a norm.</p>

<p class="stblpara">I guess the thesis about language and personality<span style=""> seems too sweeping. &nbsp;</span>Perhaps I&#8217;d be more comfortable saying,
&#8220;Language drives some personality&#8221; or &#8220;alternative language can open us to&nbsp;alternative behavior.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Is
this why groups--e.g., the military, beatniks, spy agencies, hippies,
the theater--produce a private jargon?) &nbsp;Even with
what we normally consider languages&#8212;speech based on everyday
communication&#8212;the
effect of speaking a second (or third, or whatever) language may vary
greatly for
different people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Changed behavior may
say at least as much about a person&#8217;s underlying psychology and neuroses as
about the power of the language itself.<span style="">&nbsp;
But that still leaves open the question of whether (and if so, why) a
foreign language "changes" us more than some other learned talent like,
say, bungee-jumping or preparing a meal.
</span></p>

<p class="stblpara">Then there&#8217;s the interesting though not necessarily make-or-break&nbsp;question about other kinds of "language" (which
I suppose, for those working
intensively with them, are also a kind of everyday communication), like
film or
dramaturgy or mathematics or computer programming languages.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Is a
director different on the set and off (for example, are notoriously abusive
on-set directors actually pussycats at the dinner table)?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Does the focused language and
sequence-of-events of a play (or film&#8212;or for that matter, poetry or fiction or
social-science writing) produce a &#8220;different&#8221; writer or audience member?*<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Does a
brilliant (or run-of-the-mill) mathematician (or chemist or physicist&#8230;) become
a fundamentally different person when studying or fashioning equations?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Renaissance
thinkers, especially in the 17th century, often cited mathematics as the language&nbsp;in which God "wrote" the
universe.) &nbsp;Is there a reason why computer programmers
are so often identified with nerdiness?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And so on.</p><p class="stblpara">Translation raises
interesting, related questions. &nbsp;I won't pretend to resolve issues
about how translation should balance literalism, cultural context, the
spirit of the text, subtext of the original, sounds, or imagery, nor
can I say how well any given translator masters the author's
"intention" in one or more of these areas. &nbsp;Rather, the very fact
that such questions cannot be avoided by the sensitive translator and
reader is indicative of how elusive not only precise textual meaning
(or narrative spirit) is but also the degree to which translator and reader can (or should?) be drawn into the&nbsp;"world"
in which author and text were originally framed. &nbsp;The interpretive
problem is only a bit less awkward if one is able to read the text in
its original, especially if the author inhabited a different time and
place than the reader's.</p><p class="stblpara">A bright side of kindred issues (if, indeed, the issues I've addressed&nbsp;so far reflect a dark side)
is that reading, whether in the original language or translation,
whether with deeper or shallower (to the extent we can agree on such
terms) insight into the text, is akin to travel, which for many of us
surrounds us with new possibilities about life in general and our own
lives in particular. &nbsp;Different people will explore such
possibilities to different degrees and in different way, and some may
be profoundly changed forever, some for the moment, and some only a
little;&nbsp;I doubt anyone can remain totally unchanged, though one
may <span style="font-style: italic;">claim</span> otherwise.</p><p class="stblpara">If
a language does (or can) drive personality, so can other things we
experience. Indeed, learning to talk and expanding one's expressive
abilities in general all start in imitation of&nbsp;other
personalitties. &nbsp;We start
by imitating speech we most hear, then come to try out different modes
of expression that appeal to us (like softness or sarcasm or bodily
emphasis). &nbsp;As I used to tell students when coaching them in oral
presentation,&nbsp;aside from the primary rule of finding commitment to
one's subject and letting that commitment show, trying out specific
modes of expression (e.g., a theatrical pause or an arch look) may
start out as nothing&nbsp;more than imitation, but if embraced and
integrated over time will become one's own,&nbsp;altering one's
"personality" to that extent. &nbsp;If planned novelty in thought and
behavior doesoccur in the individual or society, it begins as a tiny
variant on what is familiar.
&nbsp;To paraphrase an undergraduate mentor, Paul Fussell, one learns
to oscillate back and forth between the familiar and invention so fast
as to give the illusion of simultaneity.**</p><p class="stblpara">Then
there is the nurturing of an image of what one should be, "acting" as
though you "belong." &nbsp;After watching a couple of students ahead of me, I got past a turnstile
guard&nbsp;at Moscow
University by looking straight ahead and moving casually.
&nbsp;Crossing Red Square against traffic, I sauntered on without
looking towards a distant cop who was whistling frantically at me but
could not, I assumed, leave his post. When I taught at Harvard Business
School, before entering the classroom I typically made a conscious
decision to act <span style="font-style: italic;">as if</span> I belonged there despite my inner feeling of charlatanship.
&nbsp;When dealing with a very troubled person (angry, upset,
depressed) I have learned how to speak in a focused, low, soft voice
and find the place in me that can let genuine concern show in my voice
and body. &nbsp;In public groups, I long since learned to
recognize&nbsp;that I am avoiding true engagement when I retreat to
continuing (as opposed to momentary) stand-up comic interaction (a
version of the class clown, I suppose--the antithesis of what I was
like as a child), at which I fancy myself pretty funny.</p><p class="stblpara">Certainly oral and written style reflect specialized personality. &nbsp;Language,
of course, is intrinsically manipulative, and when speaking in public,
acting, or crafting written communication, one is fashioning a highly
filtered self to which, one hopes, others are responding with empathy
and interest--and admiration for one's imagined talent.</p><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p class="stblpara">*In theater and film, one ever-useful rule
for writer, director and actor is: &#8220;What is crucially different about this scene
from any other moment in the characters&#8217; lives?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And what I consider the basis of the best acting for most people
involves drawing on, opening oneself up to, one&#8217;s own deepest feelings and experiences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What about improvisation?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Theater of the Absurd?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As an actor I have seen, and heard of, very
peculiar, typically unpleasant out-of-the-scene behavior in other actors&#8212;and
sometimes in myself, I imagine&#8212;and I have never been sure if it&#8217;s their &#8220;real&#8221;
selves coming out or idiosyncratic behavior from stresses associated with
rehearsal or performance; since trust among actors is vital, this uncertainty has sometimes been sometimes scary.<span style="">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="stblpara"><span style="">**Fussell

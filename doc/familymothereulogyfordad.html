<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Ed had the unfortunate quality of being brutally
honest, even when a simple white lie would have sufficed; so when I speak of
him I owe him no less.&nbsp; Let me quote
from his memoirs because he said it best:</span></p>

<p style="background-color: white;"><i>&#8220;Some of the first year of
marriage was fun, perhaps ecstacy, but I was a tough sunuvabitch to get along
with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(WAS?)&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That&#8217;s true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And that&#8217;s
one part of who he was.<o:p></o:p></i>

</p><p><i>Going through some papers, I
came across a printout of an e-mail Jeff Jamieson, the son of a good friend of
ours, sent me about Ed:<o:p></o:p></i>

</p><p><i>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to hear about
Ed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He lives in my memory as the sharp,
funny, curious, rough-and-tumble yet gentle anomaly of a man that he was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was certainly a great lesson in vibrant
living.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn&#8217;t know anyone could
actively pursue so many diverse interests (marine biology, electronics, acting,
tennis&#8230;) and not explode.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And that&#8217;s
also a part of who he was.<o:p></o:p></i>

</p><p><i>His interests were
legion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was nature, as in Van
Curtlandt Park, for starters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in his
young years he worked in a dog &amp; cat hospital and on a poultry farm in
Mass., and later on his own farm in New Jersey.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And he acquired a walking tractor and cultivated an acre of land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even in Clearbrook with land and its use
severely limited, he raised tomatoes for a while. The house was filled with
tropical fish tanks which he was constantly cleaning, rearranging and
replenishing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was, of course, a
succession of dogs and, on the farm, a proliferation of cats.<o:p></o:p></i>

</p><p><i>He spotted a skunk in the
coops one day, said it was probably eating eggs, bought a shotgun*, and went
out with it that night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A little while
later he returned, looking sheepish, to tell me that the skunk looked very cute
curled up in a nest and he doubted it was eating eggs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did shoot at a stray dog to scare it away
and accidentally hit it.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That haunted
him for a long time.<o:p></o:p></i>

</p><p><i>He also loved learning and
felt seriously deficient because he had not graduated high school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, he went to night school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Using a board across the arms of a chair for
a desk, he would sit down to study every night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was Ricky&#8217;s preschool.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He would creep in under the board with his ABC book, settle himself in
Ed&#8217;s lap, and study too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Ed was
called before the draft board the day his finals were scheduled, and nobody
would give an inch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No diploma.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After discharge he took the GED, and, using
the GI Bill, went on to earn a BA, and later, an MA.**<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He loved school, not always the instructors,
but the learning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the end, watching
television, he would ask me, &#8220;what am I supposed to learn from that?&#8221;<o:p></o:p></i>

</p><p><i>He loved to read.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He enjoyed equally reading a modern novel
and a math book.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had the habit of
reading several books at a time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Books
open, face down, littered the apartment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He would spend hours browsing the used bookstores on Fourth Avenue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He found a dictionary with a broken spine,
marked down to a price we could afford&#8212;the first book we owned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he dog-eared the pages of books, and I
never got him to stop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A couple a years
back when Ricky asked him how he was, he said as long as he could read he&#8217;d be
OK.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was heart-wrenching.<o:p></o:p></i>

</p><p><i>He loved to write, churning
out poems, short stories, skits, opinion articles, seder passages, culminating
in his much-beloved memoirs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he
never developed artistic distance so he couldn&#8217;t proof and polish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whenever he set to it, he would write a new
version<span style="">&nbsp; </span>instead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></i>

</p><p><i>He liked to teach, but was
reduced to keeping order in the inner-city school system of New Brunswick.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He hated it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still, he wouldn&#8217;t transfer because he felt it was important to
be there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And he wouldn&#8217;t quit because
he felt an obligation to earn a living.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>During the school riots, when several teachers wound up in the hospital,
he was mercifully spared because, to his surprise, the kids seemed to like
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></i>

</p><p><i>He loved to act&#8212;comedy,
tragedy, drama&#8212;as long as it was a meaty role.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And though it was a<span style="">&nbsp; </span>hobby, he
took it very seriously, running lines daily, searching speeches for clues to
invention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had no patience for
dilettantes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the end, he would ask
me the same question over and over, forgetting an answer as soon as I gave it,
but in his prime he could memorize the lead in a week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He enjoyed the timing that brought a laugh
and the passion he could tear to tatters.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But most of all, he liked to reach into people and touch their
hearts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be able to bring tears to a
spectator&#8217;s eyes was his consummate acting pleasure.<o:p></o:p></i>

</p><p><i>He enjoyed photography; I
don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;ll do with all the negatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He enjoyed developing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
had a dark room built for him behind the garage in Clearbrook, but by then he
couldn&#8217;t remember the demanding sequences, the temperatures, the subtle mix of
colors, and finally abandoned it in frustration.<o:p></o:p></i>

</p><p><i>He loved fishing, fresh and
salt water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the most miserable
days of my life was when I agreed to accompany him fresh-water fishing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We slogged endlessly through weeds and
brambles, and were devoured by biting things.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I couldn&#8217;t master the skill of the cast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a disaster.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Summers, for a while, he went salt-water fishing daily in his boat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To accompany him on that, too, was a
disaster.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could sit for hours in the
sun, catching nothing, moving rods and line back and forth across the boat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Haul anchor, chug a bit, try again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was impossible to read, I never hooked
anything, and I just wanted to go home.<o:p></o:p></i>

</p><p><i>He liked walking, driving,
tennis, pool, bowling, chess and cards.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He took up scuba diving but gave it up as the costs mounted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He liked to build and repair things&#8212;and was
good at it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He built the chicken coops
by himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He succeeded in interfacing
the typewriter with the computer when the serviceman failed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He diagnosed the problem with the garage
door opener when the electrician couldn&#8217;t.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He figured out how to fix the Bendix washer when it stuck and showed me
how.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He took a correspondence course in
electronics and built a television set.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would get the color bands, but no picture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he took chances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
he was having trouble with the electricity in the coops, he stuck his finger in
a socket to test it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That he only felt
a tingle did not reassure me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Several
days later, I couldn&#8217;t find him around the farm and he didn&#8217;t answer when I
shouted around the house, so I phoned Hy, looking for him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had visions of him lying
electrocuted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hy suggested I check the
bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sure enough&#8212;sound asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could sleep!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went shopping early once, leaving him still asleep with Ricky
in his crib.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I forgot my keys.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I rang, I banged, I shouted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, I got the super to let me into the
vacant apartment above ours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
frightened to climb down the fire escape, but more frightened of what might
have happened in the apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
guessed it&#8212;sound asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Years later he
suffered from insomnia.<o:p></o:p></i>

</p><p><i>He was offended by prejudice
and discrimination but he was a man of his times, too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Breadwinning was the man&#8217;s role;
housekeeping the woman&#8217;s.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That I worked
meant that he had failed..<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I rarely
disputed it because such discussions were counterproductive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he taught himself to change and in his
latter years he became an ardent feminist&#8212;one of the first signs being that he
urged me to apply for our first credit card in my name.<o:p></o:p></i>

</p><p><i>He was an anomaly&#8212;quick to
anger at small, unintentional things but stalwart when it was important.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Teaching me to drive, he was impatient and
critical if I, for example, ground the gears.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But when I hooked the banister with the bumper and pulled the railing
off the back steps, he just repaired it and said nary a word.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I had a car accident, there was no word
of reproof, only support.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He liked to
be waited on, but when I broke my ankle, he didn&#8217;t leave the house for the six
weeks it was in a cast, waiting on me hand and foot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To pass the time, he redid the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></i>

</p><p><i>I&#8217;ve talked too much and left
out too much.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over the last years, I
watched him die.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As long as he could,
he fought it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He still performed in
Clearbrook, he still for a while, painstakingly, memorized lines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had&#8212;what irony!&#8212;no patience with those
who insisted they couldn&#8217;t memorize.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
would ask, of the dementia, &#8220;How can I lick this?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he was fighting the midgard serpent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he could no longer remember his
children&#8217;s names or that they were grownups, he still remembered them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did they need to be picked up?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had they been fed?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Were they put to bed?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
thought I had done my mourning, that I&#8217;d be happy for him that it&#8217;s over, that
it would be a relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But all I can
think of is that I&#8217;ll never see him again, that he&#8217;ll never again walk this
earth, of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>his last struggle, simply to
breath.<o:p></o:p></i>

</p><p><i>As Jeff says at the end of his
note,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;It&#8217;s not seemly that he should
end his days deprived of that great, restless, seeking consciousness.&#8221;</i></p><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p>[My
notes: *I remember this as a
.22 rifle. **My memory is that he found the Masters' education
classes&nbsp;trivial and stopped attending without formally withdrawing
from school.]</p>

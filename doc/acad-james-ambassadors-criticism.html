on that and any other subject I take up here.</span></p>
<p style="font-style: italic;" class="stblpara">It&#8217;s
been over 40 years since I read any James (none of which
I remember) in a grad school course in my early 20s; I&#8217;m pretty sure I
skimped
heavily on the required reading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two
memories about my reaction may color my current experience: I kept
thinking at
that time, &#8220;He&#8217;s a brilliant writer, but I find his content
unreadable,&#8221; and my
sketchy understanding of him was dominated by stress on point of view
and the
concomitant message of &#8220;never take the (carefully examined) text at
face
value.&#8221;<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[3]</span></span></a></p>
<p style="font-style: italic;" class="stblpara">Reading
this novel is still a chore, a busman&#8217;s holiday for a
literary critic, and the plot holds no allure for me; indeed, I find it
the
saga of a class of people deservedly defunct as the serious (as opposed
to
satiric) target of authors&#8217; attentions.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference">&nbsp;<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span style="">[4]</span></a></span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The close reading required
to make any sense
of the novel is exhausting: every phrase and line is overloaded with
implications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
this time, with the
discipline of &#8220;having&#8221; to read it so I can participate in our book
group
discussion, I have found myself increasingly stimulated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plot has not become
more engaging, but the
book stands as a gigantic, often frustrating, puzzle to me (not unlike
the
events around him that Strether has so much trouble deciphering), and I
have
found myself driven to understand what James is up to.</p>
<p class="stblpara"><span style="font-style: italic;">I have no sweeping thesis about
the novel (other than,
perhaps, James is really tough to read and understand), but without
knowing how
much of what I say has already been covered by critics, I have some
smaller
theses and analyses to offer.</span></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>My
history with critical theory</h1>
<p class="stblpara">I cut my teeth on critical
theory in my final two
undergraduate years, 1961-63.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Heavily
under the influence of admiration for Paul Fussell, Jr., then at
Rutgers, I
embraced the New Criticism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
great virtue
of this experience is that it disciplined me in close reading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The drawback, as I was to
learn over the
years, is that any single approach cuts one off from other rewarding
approaches.</p>
<p class="stblpara">After Rutgers, where I ended up
with a degree in philosophy
and was one course shy of a major in English, I had a couple of
mediocre,
uninspiring experiences as a grad student in English (Claremont and
Berkeley),
but when I returned to Berkeley in 1972 (after dropping out for five
years) and
switched to focusing on the Renaissance, my critical and intellectual
worlds
(to the extent they differ) were transformed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the time I was told that the Berkeley and Harvard
Renaissance
departments, in no particular order, were widely rated 1 and 2 in the
country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
Berkeley I found all
received truths about Renaissance thought, which was anyway new to me,
up for
grabs, and suddenly, where my truculent tendency to question received
ideas
used to come under frequent disapproval from mentors, my temperament
was
encouraged.<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[5]</span></span></a></p>
<p class="stblpara">From these years I began finding
new, gratifying approaches
to literature&#8212;to mingle with, not replace, the close reading taught me
be the
New Criticism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Norman
Rabkin&#8217;s
exposition of the anti-theatrical prejudice indirectly introduced me to
the
possibility of psychological criticism and gave me a perspective that,
by the
time I finished my dissertation (significantly updated content to be <a href="academic.html">gradually
posted on this web site</a>), I had expanded to <i>all </i>Renaissance
creative writing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stanley
Fish&#8217;s reader-response approach<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[6]</span></span></a>
opened new possibilities on how readers, writers and texts can
interact, and
how authors can set up our expectations and then toy with or &#8220;betray&#8221;
us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This approach
was reinforced for me by Paul
Alpers&#8217; examination of <i>The Faerie Queene.</i><a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[7]</span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>I grooved on Stephen
Booth&#8217;s treatment of
the political and physical implications of the setting of masques.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From sources I can&#8217;t name,
I came to embrace
biographical and historical contexts for assessing texts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I expect I was influenced
in psychological
analysis by scattered course references to Fred Crews&#8217;s work (though I
only actually
read <i>The Pooh Perplex</i><a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[8]</span></span></a>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ironically, Stephen
Greenblatt, who became
my dissertation director and with whom I took a few seminars, never got
across
to me the importance of his own ground-breaking work in attitudes
towards the
self;<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[9]</span></span></a>
but he exposed me to other fascinating critical analyses, labels for
which I
don&#8217;t even know; and since finishing the Ph.D. I have found his new
historicism, about which I have read only snippets, quite persuasive as
another
(still not THE) critical discipline.<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn10" name="_ednref10" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[10]</span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Training in acting (not
part of my graduate
education) made me sensitive to sub-text and back-stories.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most of all, and in
keeping with a
temperament probably going back to childhood, I was most fascinated by
history
of ideas (or intellectual history), which, as the basis for my
dissertation,
was to force me to learn a whole new way of writing.&#8221;<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn11" name="_ednref11" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[11]</span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that context, and as a
result of my early
immersion in sciences (which still fascinate me), I chose history of
science as
my outside doctoral field.</p>
<p class="stblpara">During my first course after my
return to Berkeley, Paul
Alpers uttered a seemingly offhand remark that became a guiding
principle: &#8220;All
criticism is autobiography.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
of my
early uses of this insight, inspired by a 1976 analysis by Ellen Moers
in the <i>New
York Review of Books</i> of the Frankenstein monster&#8217;s reflecting
Mary
Shelley&#8217;s fear of childbirth,<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn12" name="_ednref12" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[12]</span></span></a>
was the concluding chapter of my dissertation, on writers&#8217; fears of
criticism
of their work as analogous to parental fears about child-rearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reader may wish to
reflect on the
relation of my interest to the fact that early in my return to Berkeley
in
1972, I became a single parent of a 4-month old son.</p>
<h1 style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">2</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&#8220;Realism&#8221;</h1>
<p class="stblpara">At least since finishing my
philosophy degree in 1963, I have
taken for granted that, in addition to the impossibility of
&#8220;objectivity,&#8221; no
system of thought is without its internal contradictions&#8212;and that this
truth
does not intrinsically invalidate all systems of thought but rather
should
prompt us to examine them with many grains of salt, extract those
portions that
satisfy us, and ultimately build (and re-build) a set of eclectic
philosophical
principles (to the extent that we can be bothered to work out a
&#8220;philosophy&#8221;)
with consciousness of their inconsistencies.<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn13" name="_ednref13" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[13]</span></span></a></p>
<p class="stblpara">Coming to James this year,
therefore, I expected
inconsistencies in any literary theory by or about him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nor was I deceived.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This comes out, for example, in his efforts
to define a &#8220;realism&#8221; with which he claims to want to frame his fiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To summarize this
point&#8212;since it is not my
main focus, and I don&#8217;t care to re-plow well tossed ground&#8212;I&#8217;ll
recapitulate
arguments by Priscilla L. Walton (<i>The Disruption in the
Feminine in Henry
James</i>, Toronto, 1992), who contends <span style="color: black;">&#8220;It is
difficult to derive from James&#8217;s writings any clear understanding of
what he
means by the term &#8216;Realism.&#8217;&#8221; [13]<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, James is not alone in this problem.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;[H]e is like many
theorists of Realism, who also hesitate to
offer a definition of the mode because of its amorphous nature.&#8221; [13]<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The problem lies in
defining satisfactory
boundaries of &#8220;realism&#8221; within what is intrinsically &#8220;unreal&#8221;: fiction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="stblpara" style="margin-left: 40.5pt;"><span style="color: black;">[As]
Charles Rosen and Henry Zerner point out in <i>Romanticism and
Realism</i>,&#8230;
&#8216;Realist&#8217; has too often been confused with &#8216;realistic&#8230;&#8217;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Realism, as an artistic movement, began in
France in the middle of the nineteenth century and manifested itself
primarily
in the visual arts and in literature.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As an aesthetic doctrine, Realism dictated that any
aspect of life was
suitable for a novel&#8230;.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Realism&#8217;s
subject matter was to be culled from banal, everyday scenes and
situations, and
the beauty of its artistic representation was to be found in its form&#8230;.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Realism purports&#8230;to offer
an objective and
accurate representation of life as it is, not as the author might wish
it to
be. [14]<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="stblpara"><span style="color: black;">An
implicit bond must exist between
author and audience: </span>&#8220;Realist belief [holds] <span style="color: black;">that
literature contains an essential &#8216;truth&#8217; about &#8216;life,&#8217; and that the
Realist
novelist can present &#8216;reality&#8217; in such an objective and detailed
fashion that
all readers will recognize the validity of their own - and the author&#8217;s
-
vision.&#8221; [15]<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But,
as James makes clear
in his essays, this is easier said then done:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="stblpara" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="color: black;">[He]
believes that the novel must produce the &#8216;illusion of life&#8217; and suggest
the
variety of &#8216;the human spectacle,&#8217; and that these are achieved, to some
extent,
through detail&#8230;.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Authorial
intrusions
are&#8230;anathema to James, since they detract from the &#8216;air of reality&#8217; by
reminding the reader that the related events are fictional. [15-16]<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="stblpara"><span style="color: black;">This
ideal, however, is impossible
to attain: &#8220;&#8230;a series of contradictions&#8230;permeates James&#8217;s essays.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For example, how must the
novel be like
history yet not be too much like history?&#8221; [17]<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn14" name="_ednref14" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[14]</span></span></a><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="stblpara"><span style="color: black;">A
key thesis that Walton
extrapolates particularly intrigues me because it echoes for
nineteenth-century
aesthetics a topic on which I focused in my dissertation on Tudor
attitudes
towards the power of language: the degree to which writers
unconsciously
subvert their goals, revealing self-doubts about the legitimacy of what
they
write.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her own
study, Walton writes,
&#8220;is largely concerned with the ways in which James&#8217;s texts subvert
their
explicitly Realist, nineteenth-century ideology,&#8221; a phenomenon &#8220;largely
apparent in the texts&#8217; self-reflexive attempts to bind women.&#8221; [29]<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn15" name="_ednref15" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[15]</span></span></a></span><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"> </span><span style="color: black;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="stblpara">For me, interesting questions
center around the extent to
which James&#8217;s writing is internally consistent, and when it&#8217;s not, why
isn&#8217;t
it?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this point<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[16]</span></span></a>
I can&#8217;t provide sufficient answers, but in tackling how James handles
point-of-view in <i>The Ambassadors</i>, my working
hypothesis is that James

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A
bit of reader-response analysis of <i>The Ambassadors</i></h1>
<p class="stblpara" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><i>Strether&#8217;s
first question, when
he reached the hotel, was about his friend; yet on his learning that
Waymarsh
was apparently not to arrive till evening he was not wholly
disconcerted.</i><span style="">&nbsp; </span>[Opening
line of the novel, I.1/1.17]</p>
<p class="stblpara">Unless we monitor and record our
responses at every moment of
reading, it is, of course, impossible later to be sure <i>exactly
</i>what we
felt when reading a passage for the first time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Here, amplified from what I said to our CIS
discussion group, is
my stab at capturing that first reaction:</p>
<ul><li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">
</span></span>A
man with a peculiar name is introduced in a context of uncertainty
(&#8220;question&#8221;)
and will ask other questions in the course of the novel (since this is
the
&#8220;first&#8221;).</li><li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">
</span></span>Before
we hear the question, the author or narrator interrupts to let us know
Strether
is probably not at home but at a stopping point in a journey, location
not yet
known, and is probably arriving after a long walk or a vehicle ride
(&#8220;reached&#8221;)
to the &#8220;hotel&#8221; directly from an disembarkation point (train? ship?
coach?).</li><li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">
</span></span>Strether
is a conscientious person (regardless of any travel weariness or
curiosity
about his lodgings, he immediately asks about someone close to him).</li><li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">
</span></span>Strether
is conflicted: he asks a concerned question but is not upset (&#8220;yet on
his
learning&#8221;) with an answer that delays contact with his &#8220;friend&#8221;&#8212;another
character with a curious name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Does
Strether have ambivalent feelings about the friend (or how much the man
<i>is </i>a
&#8220;friend&#8221;)?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is he a
private person who
just likes time to himself?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is
his
conscientiousness a self-conscious duty rather than an admirable reflex?</li><li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">
</span></span>&#8220;Apparently&#8221;
introduces some uncertainty about exactly what is happening and what
kind of
time Strether has to himself before the arrival of his friend.</li><li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">
</span></span>It
is daylight; my first impression was afternoon rather than morning,
perhaps
because the text prompted me to expect that Strether had been already
traveling
for a while that day.</li><li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">
</span></span>For
a moment Strether&#8217;s question has a virtuous and sensitive goal (asking
about
his &#8220;friend&#8221;), but (already a mini-violation of reader expectations)
the text
immediately undermines that sense: Strether is not overly upset about
this
unexpected eventuality, but he feels uncomfortable that he is not more
troubled
(&#8220;he was not wholly disconcerted&#8221;).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If
Strether is indeed arriving from a longish trip, perhaps he feels
energized or
excited in a way that makes him want to be alone, at least for awhile.</li></ul>






<p class="stblpara">Here are a few of the added

</span></span>Strether
is indeed a man who intellectualizes&#8212;or rather,
over-intellectualizes&#8212;about
anything and everything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
is always
asking questions&#8212;and often confidently inferring wrong answers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How will this habit play
out in the ensuing
sentences at the start of the novel?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>How often this time through the novel will I notice
him getting things
wrong, and of what consequences will I now be aware (in addition to
consequences I can remember from the first reading)?</li><li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">
</span></span>This
hotel is indeed but a stopping-point in a long journey, far longer
emotionally
(and spiritually?) than the geography and travel time involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first time through the
opening chapters,
I accompanied Strether on important formative experiences in England
and
expected considerable emphasis on that country; but now I know that
Strether
will be in Paris for nearly the whole novel, and that the English
experience will
fade into a dim distance of importance (with a brief reminder at the
end when
Strether learns Chad has been to England and back).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>More than anything, however, the importance of this
hotel, is
that it is where Strether will meet Maria Gostrey.</li><li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">
</span></span>The
word &#8220;apparently&#8221; recurs, as do all sorts of other words and phrases
that raise
uncertainty (the most common, I think, is &#8220;as if&#8221;), throughout the

</span></span>If
anything, on this reading&#8212;knowing something of Strether&#8217;s travel
history&#8212;I am
more persuaded that it is afternoon (early afternoon, I suspect).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I cannot remember what
time of day Waymarsh
actually arrives, and I&#8217;ll watch for that.<span style="">&nbsp;

common New England
background will become decreasingly important; Waymarsh will become
increasingly allied with the interests of Mrs. Newsome (of whom I may
already
be thinking at this second reading) and the traditional, suffocating
life her
interests represent in contrast with Strether&#8217;s changes and the theme
of
freedom that keeps popping up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the
course of the novel, do Strether&#8217;s changes represent growth, or by the

he merely come full circle?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I

</span></span><u>Not

I became curious about background, and so I read some random secondary

out that James was

<p class="stblpara" style="margin-left: 0.75in;">The
following names that appear in <i>The
Ambassadors</i> are taken from these undated lists: the date
preceding each
given below is that of the entry immediately preceding the list from
which the
name is taken: </p>
<p class="stblpara" style="margin-left: 81pt;">August
6, 1884: &#8220;Chad&#8221;; March 4,
1985: &#8220;Mme de Vionnet&#8221;; May 11, 1895: &#8220;Gostrey&#8221;; May 16, 1899:
&#8220;Newsome,&#8221;
&#8220;Milrose,&#8221; &#8220;Waymark&#8221; (the last is the name James used for Waymarsh in
his
preliminary statement for <i>The Ambassadors</i>); August
9, 1900: &#8220;Strether&#8221;;
September 11, 1900: &#8220;Bilham,&#8221; Barrace.&#8221;</p>
<p class="stblpara" style="margin-left: 0.75in;">[Editor&#8217;s
commentary within the
Norton Critical Edition, 371-2]</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">I
don&#8217;t know what to make of
James&#8217;s attraction to most of these names, but the change from Waymark
to
Waymarsh prompts a suspicion (possible just from reading the novel, but
I
didn&#8217;t think of it at the time) that &#8220;marsh&#8221; should elicit thoughts of
entanglement, staleness, and perhaps some vague stench.<span class="MsoEndnoteReference">&nbsp;<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title=""><span style="">[20]</span></a></span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This attention also makes
me reflect a bit
more on why Mme de Vionnet and Miss Gostrey have such similar first
names&#8212;what
similarities should we find in them and the tension between them?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Does the near difference
in names suggest
two similar people who can&#8217;t get in synch?<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn21" name="_ednref21" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[21]</span></span></a></div>
<p class="stblpara">Now that I&#8217;ve outlined my own
first and second responses to
this sentence (and assuming they are representative of other readers&#8217;
experiences), the question is: does any of that help our appreciation
of the
text in any way?<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn22" name="_ednref22" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[22]</span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>I only have limited
answers to that question
right now, but since I think answers are related to how James handles
point-of-view in <i>The Ambassadors</i>,<i> </i>let
me move to that topic.</p>
<h1 style="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">4</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Point
of view technique in <i>The Ambassadors</i></h1>
<p class="stblpara">Had I not been anticipating
point-of-view issues, I would
probably have started <i>The Ambassadors</i> assuming an
omniscient
third-person narrator and maybe before too long have shifted to
&#8220;narrator
inside Strether&#8217;s thoughts and feelings.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(One question, then&#8212;for which I don&#8217;t have an
answer: did James set up
this sequence of reader responses?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Probably not, but if he did, why?)</p>
<p class="stblpara">That the narrator somehow has
access to Strether&#8217;s brain and
feelings seems to be the common attitude of critics.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So far as I know, it was first set forth by Percy
Lubbock in
1921, who writes that the book &#8220;never passes outside the circle of his
[Strether&#8217;s] thought,&#8221; [<i>The Craft of Fiction</i>, 414]<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[23]</span></span></a>
although a couple of pages later he qualifies this: &#8220;the point of view
is
primarily Strether&#8217;s.&#8221; [415]<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lubbock
adds that &#8220;our point of view is his [Strether&#8217;s]&#8221; [419] and that
James&#8217;s
&#8220;Strether is apparently in the position of a narrator<b> </b>throughout.&#8221;
[420]</p>
<p class="stblpara">While such a perspective is
complex to the extent that we
find Strether himself complex, it is still a relatively straightforward
principle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Were we
able to take <i>all </i>the
narrative as Strether&#8217;s own words (or thoughts), it would offer a
promising
interpretive approach that would allow us to question at every moment
what the
narrative has right and what it doesn&#8217;t, and what those answers tell us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But while Strether is <i>always
</i>on the
narrative stage, his presence does not mean that all actions must be
from his
point of view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
narrative voice, I
think, is much more complex and elusive&#8212;or, to put it another way, if
Strether <i>were
</i>the narrator, then James&#8217;s skill would frequently be
lacking, because I
find frequent &#8220;slippages&#8221; away from Strether.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I think they are deliberate.</p>
<p class="stblpara">From time to time, for example,
the narrator appears to pass
his<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[24]</span></span></a>
own judgments independently of Strether&#8217;s point of view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is always
possible that such
moments are authorial inconsistencies (in the spirit of &#8220;even
Shakespeare
nods&#8221;), I find the novel too carefully worked out to jump to such a
conclusion.<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[25]</span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The most obvious of
moments when the
narrator is looking at Strether from the outside are repetitions of
phrases like
&#8220;our friend&#8221; and &#8220;poor Strether.&#8221;</p>
<p class="stblpara">Sometimes the narrator seems to
be commenting on Strether or
speaking directly to us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Learning
that
Chad &#8220;went about little in the &#8216;colony&#8217;&#8221; and &#8220;had quite another
interest,&#8221;
Strether concludes that the &#8220;interest&#8221; is a &#8220;deep&#8221; one, but: &#8220;He
couldn&#8217;t see
as yet how deep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Might
he not all
too soon!</u>&#8221; [IV.2/9.103; emphasis added]<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[26]</span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes the narrator
seems to be in
another character&#8217;s, as when Strether visits Maria after receiving Mrs.
Newsome&#8217;s ultimatum by cable: &#8220;Strether&#8217;s hostess, <u>it might
have been made
out</u>, just escaped changing colour.&#8221; [VII.3/2.190; emphasis
added]<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[27]</span></span></a></p>
<p class="stblpara">On a few occasions the narrator
is self-conscious, as when he
writes, &#8220;If we should go into all that occupied our friend in the
watches of
the night we should have to mend our pen; but an instance or two may
mark for
us the vividness with which he could remember,&#8221; [III.2/7.91] where
&#8220;mend our
pen&#8221; (as opposed to &#8220;we&#8221; or &#8220;us,&#8221; which the narrator often says) offers
a flash
of writer-narrator (but not James) scribbling in his manuscript.<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[28]</span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>At another point he is
actually &#8220;I&#8221;: &#8220;the
quickening, as I have called it&#8230;&#8221; [VII.3/18.195]<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn29" name="_ednref29" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[29]</span></span></a></p>
<p class="stblpara">In this section I (your
commentator) am, alas, severely
limited by lack of knowledge of other works of James; I do not know how
much of
what I address may be generally true of how he handles point of view or
how
specific are the techniques in <i>The Ambassadors</i>.</p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="color: black;">Many
times the text reports events
that occur between the current narrative moment and the time when the
author/narrator is telling the tale.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The question: who exactly is relating that knowledge
of what is to come?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="stblpara"><span style="color: black;">For
example, at the end of Book I
Waymarsh returns from a &#8220;mysterious&#8221; errand and &#8220;</span>though
they were
convinced he had made some extraordinary purchase they were never to
learn its
nature.&#8221; [I.3.3.41]<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn30" name="_ednref30" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[30]</span></span></a><span style="color: black;"><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While often the
narrator is so much in Strether&#8217;s head as to provide a tone of
immediacy to
what &#8220;our friend&#8221; is thinking or feeling, at moments like this
&#8220;forecast&#8221; it
does not seem possible that Strether is speaking.<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[31]</span></span></a><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="stblpara"><span style="color: black;">In
a more complex way (or so it
seems at the time), when concluding the discussion between Strether and
Maria
over what the Woollett factory manufactures, James toys with the line
not just
between narrator and Strether but also with the author.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The narrative informs us: &#8220;</span>But it may
even now frankly be mentioned that he in the sequel never <i>was
</i>to tell
her.&#8221; [<span style="color: black;">II.1/4.48)]</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not seem possible
that &#8220;frankly&#8221; can be Strether&#8217;s word;
it must be &#8220;spoken&#8221; by someone who is judging Strether&#8212;the fictive
narrator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The more
cunning part of the
manipulation here, however, must be James&#8217;s own, for it is deliberate
trickery,
never a trait of our narrator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
phraseology (&#8220;he in the sequel never <i>was </i>to tell
her&#8221;) encourages us to
think that the whole topic will never arise again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We may speculate about the product, but we know (or
think we
know) neither Maria nor, by proxy, we will ever again get a chance to
identify
it&#8212;though we may entertain ourselves by seeking to determine it from
hints
elsewhere in the text.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I
don&#8217;t think
such efforts can ever be conclusive; if James actually drops such
hints, as
some critics argue, it is to tease rather than gratify the reader.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When James <i>does</i>
re-raise the question
towards the end of the novel, he also re-raises our curiosity and
allows us to
think, briefly, that we will finally get an answer (and, by the way,
thereby
test whatever theory we contrived about the product).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>James quickly twists our expectations yet again:
Maria passes up
both her and our chance to learn the product.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, Maria is right: knowing the product is
irrelevant to anything
about the events of the novel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our
own
(selfish) frustration at Maria&#8217;s decision reveals our culpability at
being
distracted by such red herrings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
we
find the narrative difficult (as I certainly do), we collude in
exacerbating
that problem by allowing James (not the narrator) to promote our focus
on such
distractions.</p>
<p class="stblpara">If this were the only occurrence
of such a &#8220;manipulation,&#8221; my
argument about reader culpability would be making much more of a
possibly
clever deception than is warranted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But
the novel frequently provides equivalent &#8220;shocks&#8221; at broad levels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I first came upon the
description of
Strether&#8217;s loss of wife and son [II.1/4.43], I had to re-read the lines
a
couple of times to assure myself that they said what I thought they
did; the
casual way James injects such disturbing information into the
narrative&#8212;and

VIII.2/20.210]&#8212;may prompt us to consider this history as motivating
Strether&#8217;s
current actions, but it is also deeply disturbing and, at some level,
bewildering (like the unnamed product of Mrs. Newsome&#8217;s factory?).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similar sexual confusion
abounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Throughout
the novel James toys with the

together&#8212;and then surprises both reader and Strether with the rowboat

late in the novel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Indeed,
even there
we must infer the information.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
contemporary culture within which James was writing and to which he
seems
responsive in its silence on sexual matters re-inforces our
uncertainty,
because James only obliquely, euphemistically, has the text or
characters refer
to sex, though again and again our prurient minds (and presumably those
of
James&#8217;s contemporary readers) respond to suggestions of sexual
improprieties<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">,

Strether&#8217;s exact

the

occurs
at VIII.1/19.202-3, as we learn that the Pococks are arriving in
France, to be
met at Havre and accompanied on to Paris:</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><big>It was the advantage of
his having let his fancy
lose itself for a little in the gloom that, as by reaction, the
prospect began
really to brighten from the moment the deputation from Woollett
alighted on the
platform of the station. They had come straight from Havre, having
sailed from
New York to that port, and having also, thanks to a happy voyage, made
land
with a promptitude that left Chad Newsome, who had meant to meet them
at the dock,
belated. He had received their telegram, with the announcement of their
immediate further advance, just as he was taking the train for Havre,
so that
nothing had remained for him but to await them in Paris. He hastily
picked up
Strether, at the hotel, for this purpose, and he even, with easy
pleasantry,
suggested the attendance of Waymarsh as well--Waymarsh, at the moment
his cab
rattled up, being engaged, under Strether&#8217;s contemplative range, in a
grave
perambulation of the familiar court. Waymarsh had learned from his
companion,
who had already had a note, delivered by hand, from Chad, that the
Pococks were
due, and had ambiguously, though, as always, impressively, glowered at
him over
the circumstance; carrying himself in a manner in which Strether was
now expert
enough to recognise his uncertainty, in the premises, as to the best
tone. The
only tone he aimed at with confidence was a full tone--which was
necessarily
difficult in the absence of a full knowledge. The Pococks were a
quantity as
yet unmeasured, and, as he had practically brought them over, so this
witness
had to that extent exposed himself. He wanted to feel right about it,
but could
only, at the best, for the time, feel vague. &#8220;I shall look to you, you
know,
immensely,&#8221; our friend had said, &#8220;to help me with them,&#8221; and he had
been quite
conscious of the effect of the remark, and of others of the same sort,
on his
comrade&#8217;s sombre sensibility. He had insisted on the fact that Waymarsh
would
quite like Mrs. Pocock--one could be certain he would: he would be with
her
about everything, and she would also be with HIM, and Miss Barrace&#8217;s
nose, in
short, would find itself out of joint.</big><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="stblpara" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: 0.5in;">Strether had
woven
this web of cheerfulness while they waited in the court for Chad; he
had sat
smoking cigarettes to keep himself quiet while, caged and leonine, his
fellow
traveller paced and turned before him. Chad Newsome was doubtless to be
struck,
when he arrived, with the sharpness of their opposition at this
particular
hour; he was to remember, as a part of it, how Waymarsh came with him
and with
Strether to the street and stood there with a face half-wistful and
half-rueful. They talked of him, the two others, as they drove, and
Strether
put Chad in possession of much of his own strained sense of things. He
had
already, a few days before, named to him the wire he was convinced
their friend
had pulled--a confidence that had made on the young man&#8217;s part quite
hugely for
curiosity and diversion.</p>
<p class="stblpara">I have had to read this section
again and again, and only
when I came to write the following did it gradually (again with
numerous
readings and re-tracings) make sense to me.</p>
<p class="stblpara">We learn that &#8220;the deputation
from Woollett alighted on the
platform of the station.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Though
unspecified, this must be a train station in Paris, because &#8220;They had
come
straight from Havre.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
narrator
explains that Chad was unable to &#8220;meet them at the dock&#8221; but had to
&#8220;await them
in Paris.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
cab ride to the Paris
station, Chad stops to pick up Strether &#8220;at the hotel, for this
purpose, and he
even, with easy pleasantry, suggested the attendance of Waymarsh as
well...&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;This
purpose&#8221; has no
antecedent; we assume it refers to meeting the Pococks at the station;
nor does
the narrative explain how Chad alerted Strether to this improvised plan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The redundancy of &#8220;even&#8221;
and &#8220;as well&#8221; echo
Strether&#8217;s awkward feelings towards the friend who has betrayed him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the moment, though, we
don&#8217;t know how
Waymarsh has come into the picture; this is clarified only in the next
phrase,
following an em-dash: &#8220;Waymarsh, at the moment his cab rattled up,
being
engaged, under Strether's contemplative range, in a grave perambulation
of the
familiar court.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since
the most recent
antecedent of &#8220;his&#8221; (in &#8220;his cab rattled up&#8221;) is Waymarsh, why, I
wondered, did
Waymarsh just happen to appear in a cab at this moment, and why is that
cab
circling in the courtyard?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact,
time is running backward, and the cab is Chad&#8217;s: Waymarsh was strolling
in the
hotel courtyard; Strether was silently watching him; Chad&#8217;s cab drove
up to the
&#8220;court&#8221; on its way to the station.</p>
<p class="stblpara">Time continues to move in
reverse, to slightly before
Waymarsh is &#8220;perambulating&#8221;: &#8220;Waymarsh had learned from his companion,
who had
already had a note, delivered by hand, from Chad, that the Pococks were
due, and
had ambiguously, though, as always, impressively, glowered at him over
the
circumstance&#8230;&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Ambiguously&#8221;
applies to
the narrative itself here as much as to the (supposedly) unclear
meaning of
Waymarsh&#8217;s &#8220;glower.&#8221;</p>
<p class="stblpara">Now we move slightly forward in
time, from Waymarsh&#8217;s
learning of the Pococks&#8217; arrival to the moment he and Strether are in
the
courtyard waiting for Chad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
move
firmly inside Strether&#8217;s head to listen to him reflect on how the
Pococks&#8217;
presence will affect the world of those around him; with an intriguing
meanness, he relishes the thought of Ms. Barrace&#8217;s imminent
discomfiture at
Sarah&#8217;s presence: &#8220;He had insisted on the fact that Waymarsh would
quite like
Mrs. Pocock--one could be certain he would: he would be with her about
everything, and she would also be with <i>him</i>, and
Miss Barrace's nose, in
short, would find itself out of joint.&#8221;</p>
<p class="stblpara">A new paragraph begins by
suspending time to set the context
for Strether&#8217;s uncharitable thoughts and to drag out (as Strether and
Waymarsh
must have felt time dragged while they waited) this period of relative
inaction: &#8220;Strether had woven this web of cheerfulness while they
waited in the
court for Chad; he had sat smoking cigarettes to keep himself quiet
while,
caged and leonine, his fellow traveller paced and turned before him.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Woven this web of
cheerfulness&#8221; juxtaposes
the image of a patiently malevolent spider with the irony of
&#8220;cheerfulness&#8221; as
a description of Strether&#8217;s churlish ruminations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Waymarsh&#8217;s being &#8220;caged&#8221; raises the question of who
is actually
caging him and why he feels that way.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="stblpara">Then, from this moment in the
courtyard (in between Chad&#8217;s
hurrying to meet the Pococks and the moment of the Pococks&#8217; actual
arrival in
Paris), we visit a speculative future (via multiple uses of &#8220;was&#8221; + an
infinitive):
&#8220;Chad Newsome was doubtless to be struck, when he arrived, with the
sharpness
of their opposition at this particular hour&#8230;&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was once alerted to the principle that the term
&#8220;doubtless&#8221; (or &#8220;no
doubt&#8221;) intrinsically raises doubt, and I think that is true here&#8212;that
Strether
is trying to persuade himself of what Chad will think.<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn39" name="_ednref39" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[39]</span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Was&#8230;to be struck, when he
arrived&#8221; is
anticipating Chad&#8217;s imminent, but future, arrival in the court, and
Strether is
(impatiently, surely) awaiting (hoping for) Chad&#8217;s recognition of the
sudden
tension in the Strether-Waymarsh relationship (and, we may infer, that
Chad
will at once take Strether&#8217;s side against Waymarsh).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After a semi-colon, the narrative repeats the syntax
but with
what feels like a shifted point of view: &#8220;he [Chad] was to remember, as
a part
of it, how Waymarsh came with him and with Strether to the street and
stood
there with a face half-wistful and half-rueful.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is no longer clear that this is Strether&#8217;s
speculation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
reads more like a statement of fact by
the narrator in his wisdom as he writes the account from the future.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it is not clear if
the street scene
is already happening in the narrative or is only in Strether&#8217;s mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For in the <i>next </i>sentence,
with no
apparent transition, the cab seems to have left the hotel and is
continuing to
the station: &#8220;They talked of him, the two others, as they drove, and
Strether
put Chad in possession of much of his own strained sense of things.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Are Chad and Strether
talking about
Waymarsh, and is Waymarsh not in the cab even though Chad invited him?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, but it takes a few
readings to get
that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is this why,
a sentence earlier,
Waymarsh looked &#8220;half-wistful and half-rueful?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Does Strether&#8217; &#8220;strained sense of things&#8221; refer to
his rift with
Waymarsh over the latter&#8217;s letters to Mrs. Newsome that brought the
Pococks to
Paris?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently
yes: we move back in
time again to learn: &#8220;He [Strether] had already, a few days before,
named to
him the wire he was convinced their friend had pulled--a confidence
that had
made on the young man's part quite hugely for curiosity and diversion.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So maybe &#8220;doubtless&#8221; was <i>not</i>
a term
of insecurity.<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn40" name="_ednref40" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[40]</span></span></a></p>
<p class="stblpara">Many generalizations based on
this passage come to mind, but
I suspect they would be insufficiently developed without much further
thought
and reading, so I shall forego them for now.<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn41" name="_ednref41" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[41]</span></span></a></p>

point of view</h2>
<i>Most</i> adverbs<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn42" name="_ednref42" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[42]</span></span></a>
in the novel reflect Strether&#8217;s own sensibility, as in the opening
sentence
cited above and the second sentence after it (my emphasis added):
<p class="stblpara" style="margin-left: 31.5pt;">The
same secret principle,
however, that had prompted Strether <u>not absolutely</u>
to desire Waymarsh&#8217;s
presence at the dock, that had led him thus to postpone for a few hours
his
enjoyment of it, now operated to make him feel he could still wait
without
disappointment&#8230;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>[I.1/1.17]</p>
<p class="stblpara">These Stretherian adverbs
underscore what comes to seem an
endless series of qualifications (cf. &#8220;apparently&#8221;) within the novel, a
telling
topic but not one I will address further.</p>
<p class="stblpara">In a sizable minority of cases,
however, clarifying adverbs
seem to come from the same narrator who is for a moment <i>not </i>in
Strether&#8217;s head&#8212;the narrator who can stand aloof and say &#8220;poor
Strether.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
occasions have gradations of
point-of-view precision: several pages into the book, for example, we
read that
&#8220;Waymarsh&#8217;s acknowledgement&#8230;was characteristically indirect,&#8221;
[I.2/2.33] where
&#8220;characteristically&#8221; might reflect Strether&#8217;s judgment but at least as
possibly
is the &#8220;narrator&#8217;s&#8221; comment.<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn43" name="_ednref43" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[43]</span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>But in other places the
distance between
narrator and Strether is more clear-cut: in Book IX, for example, the
narrator
comments that Maria &#8220;candidly echoed&#8221; words of Strether&#8217;s<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn44" name="_ednref44" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[44]</span></span></a>
and adds that Strether &#8220;fancifully expressed the issue&#8221; [IX.3/24.244]
when
declaiming his commitment to Chad&#8217;s well-being.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While &#8220;candidly&#8221; could remotely be Strether&#8217;s
description, I
don&#8217;t see how &#8220;fancifully&#8221; could.<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn45" name="_ednref45" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[45]</span></span></a></p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><small>Hans
Holbein, <i>The Ambassadors </i>(1533), National Gallery,
London </small></div>
<p class="stblpara">The problem is that paintings
don&#8217;t actually move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
while many may try to portray movement, Holbein&#8217;s painting does not.</p>
<p class="stblpara">Having barely started to
understand the connection (in terms of point of view) that I describe
in this section, I can only outline some thoughts, and I expect much
more should be worked out.</p>
<p class="stblpara">Renaissance painting, of course,
played extensively with perspective (cf. point of view), and Holbein&#8217;s
painting is famous for its use of an anamorphosis, the shape at the
lower center of this painting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
make out that it is a skull, the viewer has to stand at the edge of the
frame and look sideways at the painting&#8230;which simultaneously distorts
the rest of the painting&#8212;or, depending on your point of view, throws it
into correct perspective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
presence of the skull is a standard reminder of mortality even in the
midst of worldly success; the related slogan is <i>et in arcadia
ego</i>, &#8220;I am also in Arcadia&#8221;: the synonym for a pastoral
paradise is not truly a celestial Eden but a fallen earthly place of
mortality and decay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
despite its use in Holbein&#8217;s worldly image, the theme is typically
applied to rural/pastoral settings and dallying young lovers. &nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Related
motifs&#8212;actually, they overlap to the point at times of being mirrors of each
other &#8212;are <i>carpe diem</i>, <i>ubi sunt </i>and <i>memento mori</i>.</span></p>
<p class="stblpara">James claims,<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn49" name="_ednref49" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[49]</span></span></a>
of course,&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">that
Strether&#8217;s <i>carpe diem </i>lecture in Gloriani&#8217;s garden to Bilham is the
central theme of the novel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style=""> </span>That aside, we can look at
the various points of view I outlined above as coming from a special
kind of omniscient narrator, with specific rules.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The first rule is that Strether is always present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A second is that most of
the point of view will be via Strether&#8217;s thoughts and feelings, though
sometimes the narrator may be able to articulate feelings of which
Strether is not conscious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
third rule is that the narrator, without ever having Strether leave the
scene, may <i>very briefly </i>(a few words, as we saw
above) comment on the action, either via a momentary point of view of
another character or with a detached observer&#8217;s judgment.</p>
<p class="stblpara">The reason I like the image of a
hand-held movie camera is that, like our narrator, it both
editorializes and has unavoidable boundaries.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We see everything through the camera lens, or rather
through the eye of the cameraperson who is pointing the lens, and we
are always aware of that person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Whenever
I see dangerous footage, especially in documentaries, such as scenes of
skydiving, I think about the person who is filming the action.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In normal filmmaking (at
least for films with decent budgets), scenes are shot multiple times
and from different angles, and later different bits are spliced
together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in
a dialogue, the screen image may move back and forth between the faces
of the speakers, but we usually see any given moment over the shoulder
and from behind the other speaker.</p>
<p class="stblpara">My conceit here is that James&#8217;s
scenes are &#8220;shot&#8221; non-stop, and the photographer must concentrate on
holding the camera steady while accurately capturing the scene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moving the camera to
another character runs risks and must be done rarely and with great
care.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the same
time, if we add the image of a zoom lens and throw in some filters, the
camera need not be positioned close to Strether but can do close-ups as
needed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
scene when Strether is sitting alone at the Cheval Blanc, the camera
can do close-ups of his face as well as move around the scene and pan
backwards and forwards to pick up the boat in the river and the people
in it, now unidentifiable, now coming into focus.</p>
<p class="stblpara">As I read this scene for the
first time (but having listened to the recording and hence knowing
generally what was to come) I kept thinking of the Pastorella episode
in Book VI <i>The Faerie Queene</i>, in which a pastoral
paradise seems to the reader an eternal, glorious Eden until it is
suddenly razed by a band of marauding brigands.<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn50" name="_ednref50" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[50]</span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>That action is Spenser&#8217;s
version of the anamorphic skull in Holbein&#8217;s painting.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>James captures a similar effect with the long rural
build-up&#8212;framed by his memories of the Lambinet painting<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn51" name="_ednref51" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[51]</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&#8212;</span>of
Strether&#8217;s day in the country, a radical break with the urban
domination of the rest of the novel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The twist in James is that Strether does not feel
betrayed by the&nbsp;truth that disturbs his peaceful universe but by the fact that the truth was kept from him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, he has come full
circle on sexual matters since he left the U.S.: before meeting Chad in
Paris, his expectation is that any sexual liaison would be corrupting,
and he&#8212;like the reader&#8212;misinterprets &#8220;virtuous attachment&#8221; to mean
chaste as opposed to loving, devoted, sublime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By the river scene, Strether is able to feel
compassion for lovers like Chad and Mme de Vionnet, who cannot marry
even if they want to; they are "living," as Strether insisted to Bilham one should.</p>
<p class="stblpara">I asked a version of this
question earlier: to what degree would James&#8217;s readers need to go
through Strether&#8217;s education&#8212;that is, to what degree would his readers
assume that lack of unmarried chastity meant corruption and sin?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If they <i>did</i>
share Strether&#8217;s opening assumption, then the novel manipulates their
education in a similar way to Milton&#8217;s seduction of readers into
empathizing with Satan and thereby replicating the Original Sin of Adam
and Eve.</p>
<p class="stblpara">It might be possible to apply a
similar reading via a motif that James uses throughout the novel both
literally and metaphorically: theater, and more generally, performance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stage has rigid
boundaries, we don&#8217;t get to see what is in the wings, blocking can
shape our perspective to events and dialogue, asides can interrupt the
action briefly (but to set us straight), secrets are held and
disclosed, and actors&#8217; technique can send silent messages and feelings
to the audience.<a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_edn52" name="_ednref52" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[52]</span></span></a></p>
<p class="stblpara">I will end these speculations
here, hoping it is a useful start but frustrated that it does not yet
seem enough to explain the shifting points of view in the novel.

All references to the novel are to the 1963 Norton Critical Edition
that uses the 1909 text from the collected works, which James reviewed
for publication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
help readers find citations in their own educations, I am both
attaching a searchable Word file (my source for copying and pasting
quotations into this commentary) to this web page and, when I identify
a citation, listing Book number (of 12), chapter number within that
Book, sequential chapter number (of 36) within the novel as a whole,
and the page number.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(For
example, II.1/4.51 = Book II, chapter 2 in Book II, chapter 4 overall
within the novel, and p. 51 of the 1963 Norton Critical Edition.)</p>

Obvious caveats: Aside from having no memories of other James writing
with which to contrast this novel, I have read little secondary
information on James, nor am I well versed in point-of-view theory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In keeping with my
motivation for setting up my web site several months ago, however, I
publish this commentary, with its limitations, on my web site as an
outlet for my thoughts, regardless of whether anyone reads them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case, it is also
salutary for me to re-capture academic writing skills that have largely
lain dormant for many, many years.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Of course I also hope that the content will interest
some people, and that a fresh reading may reveal dimensions of the text
that get lost when one knows a lot.</p>

This may be a function of the passage of time: perhaps I don&#8217;t identify
with or greatly care about any of the characters merely because they
are alien to my experiences and interests a century after James wrote
the novel.</p>

A prime example: perhaps before I even started classes this time&#8212;maybe
even to help me decide whether to return to graduate study&#8212;I visited a
Berkeley eighteenth-century specialist whom I had never met, Gardner
Stout, to discuss with him a long paper on Swift that I had written
five years earlier and for which I had received a B- (the grad school
grade that says, &#8220;this is a very bad paper but I don&#8217;t quite have the
guts to give you what in grad school would be a failing grade&#8221;).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gardner generously offered
to read the paper, and later told me he found it the most committed
graduate paper he had ever read.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Make
what you will of this, but you may understand my confusion at exactly
what to do next.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
had chosen eighteenth century mainly because that was Fussell&#8217;s
specialty when I studied with him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Now&#8212;I don&#8217;t remember how&#8212;I decided to try
Renaissance study, even though it meant I would almost be starting from
scratch.</p>

I first encountered this in <i>Surprised by Sin (</i><span style="">Berkeley, 1971</span>), a book-length
analysis of <i style="">Paradise Lost</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Fish&#8217;s promulgation of reader response criticism
counsels against &#8220;correcting&#8221; a first impression as though your first
reading were wrong and you need to change it to the &#8220;right&#8221; answer.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, Fish urges,
authors intrinsically toy with and violate reader expectations, and we
should accept our first impression but later reflect on how second and
further impressions vary from it (and each other)&#8212;and what such
variations reveal about what the author is really doing, how he or she
is manipulating readers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
instance, Fish argues that the rhetorical movement of <i>Paradise
Lost</i> deliberately lures readers into recapitulating the
primal sin&#8212;for example, at least in the earlier Books, by admiring
Satan&#8217;s seeming grandeur&#8212; to show their ongoing complicity in
humankind&#8217;s fall.</p>
<p class="stblpara">I have consistently found that
it pays to ask the kind of question Fish raises, at least of good
writers, before assuming a writer (or the reader) has simply goofed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While at any given moment
a reader-response (or any) approach can be extravagant or forced, in my
experience Fish&#8217;s technique works well a great deal of the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And even when overdone
(assuming we could agree on that definition) I have found it offering
intriguing hints to understanding that would not occur to me any other
way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="stblpara">In the spirit of historical
criticism, I would note that the technique was apt in its time and the
place I encountered it, the early 70s in Northern California, when I (a
single parent insecure about my legitimacy in that role), like many
others, was trying to develop sensitivity about who I &#8220;really&#8221; was and
what feelings and responses to life were legitimate.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

his career successes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
me he was always generous, kind and supportive, and I have often felt I

I threw out hundreds of pages of draft (sometimes saving quotations or
paragraphs I liked so that I could staple them to new drafts&#8212;this was,
of course, pre-word processing), and then one day, after maybe two
years, maybe less, maybe more, of frustration, got the feel for what
was required and wrote the entire dissertation in 6 weeks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This long confusion
followed by a kind of indefinable epiphany was a much more troublesome
version of how one day, some weeks into plane geometry in high school,
I suddenly, viscerally understood what a theorem was about and coasted
in the course the rest of the year.</p>

For example, one may believe in the legitimacy of civil disobedience
for the &#8220;right&#8221; causes (i.e., those one supports) but recognize that
others may justify civil disobedience for &#8220;wrong&#8221; ones (those, of
course, to which one objects), as in the use of sit-ins to further
racial justice vs. their use to block entry to abortion clinics.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this example suggests,
I would note that for me, ethics and politics should coincide; of
course they almost never do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
kind of attitude eventually also made me lose interest in critical
theory as a discipline and instead find value in a wide range of
approaches to literature (and life) without worrying about how well
they fit together as a system.</p>

Trollope, James &#8220;associates &#8216;common life&#8217; with vulgarity, an
association which suggests that for him, only an aristocratic or
genteel &#8216;reality&#8217; is acceptably &#8216;real.&#8217;&#8221; [18]<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He is &#8220;always emphatic in his assertion that the
novel has no &#8216;conscious moral purpose&#8230;.&#8217;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the moralism he disclaims is apparent in
his disapproval of excessive treatments of &#8216;man&#8217;s carnal side&#8217; because
he believes that any excess unbalances the picture of &#8216;life&#8217;&#8230;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted that
James&#8217;s very specific and rather (at least to the modern mind)
squeamish notions of the <i>acceptably </i>&#8216;real&#8217; are
individual to him and are not shared by all Realist theorists.&#8221; [19]</li><li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">
</span></span>Walton
addresses James&#8217;s personal aristocratic bent: &#8220;Although James&#8217;s own
fictional works tend to be rather selective or &#8216;aristocratic&#8217; in the
nature of their subjects, they do represent an attempt, as James
professes, to mirror &#8216;life&#8217;; they are seemingly detailed and objective,
promise closure, and convey the belief that what can be seen can be
articulated and known&#8230;.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
Realism is an inherently slippery concept, it is also a rather unstable
concept, even by traditional definitions, because it assumes that
author and reader have a shared knowledge of &#8216;truth&#8217; and &#8216;reality,&#8217; and
chooses to ignore the necessarily arbitrary nature of its own
particular perception of &#8216;life.&#8217;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
its implicit assumption that &#8216;truth&#8217; can be known and articulated by
the author and then recognized by the discerning reader, Realism also

Realist/humanist perspective, they generate manifest difficulties&#8230;.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Women are used, like
tools, as a means of seeing, or more precisely, of interpreting. But in
this, they perform an integral function within the novel, for each
major female character embodies a particular mode of reading. Although
they also function as author figures, in this capacity they inspire a
particular approach to the texts they create. As a result, their
authorial roles become a further means of exemplifying their
theoretical stance. Mrs Newsome is a proponent of Realist/humanist
reading and repre­sents the need for referentiality; Maria Gostrey is
an intermediary figure who teaches Strether to decipher, but to
decipher in a way which promotes misreadings; and Madame de Vionnet
actually per­sonifies the open text, which she then helps Strether to
interpret plurally. Strether evolves through each woman&#8217;s tutelage to
the point where he too, ultimately, embraces multiplicity. [105]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

excluding woman from the field of representation, draws its momentum
from the representation of bound women, and that binding implicitly
recognizes woman&#8217;s energy and the patriarchal order&#8217;s dependence on it

I noticed a single moment where I question whether this is true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first sentence of
XII.4/35 (p. 332), the text says: &#8220;He was to delay no longer to
re-establish communication with Chad, and we have just seen that he had
spoken to Miss Gostrey of this intention on hearing from her of the
young man&#8217;s absence.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
&#8220;reminder&#8221; (&#8220;we have just seen&#8221;) jars, as though it were put there as a
jog to the reader&#8217;s memory during serialization and inadvertently
retained for publication (although this chapter would be in the middle
of the final serial installment).<span style="">&nbsp;

The most overqualified moment in the book&#8212;a triple axel, so to
speak&#8212;is, I think, Miss Barrace&#8217;s reaction when Strether seems
noncommittal to her description of him as a hero (emphasis added): &#8220;And
then as he <u>seemed</u> <u>perhaps</u> <u>not
quite</u> to take fire...&#8221; [X.1/25.265]<span style="">&nbsp;

Careful comparison of their homes might contribute to this answer, as
the text invites when referring to &#8220;the matters that marked Madame de
Vionnet's apartment as something quite different from Miss Gostrey's
little museum of bargains and from Chad's lovely home.&#8221; [VI.1/13.145]</p>

A typical reader-response answer would be: It will show us that as

</span>And that may well be true.<span style="">&nbsp;

Surely the narrator is male, though assuming a female narrator&#8212;perhaps
an unspecific one, perhaps Maria Gostrey or someone like her&#8212;might
produce unexpected rewards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
anyone wants to stagger down that path, I note that when Maria is
recounting Mme de Vionnet&#8217;s history to Strether, the text calls her
&#8220;Strether&#8217;s narrator.&#8221; [V.3/12.139]</p>

Other examples: the phrase &#8220;it had better be confessed at the outset&#8221;
in this early, pregnant sentence: &#8220;He was burdened, poor Strether&#8212;it
had better be confessed at the outset&#8212;with the oddity of a double
consciousness.&#8221; [I.1/1.18]<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
Notre Dame, when Strether has not yet recognized Mme de Vionnet, the
narrator comments:<span style="color: black;"> &#8220;</span>Strether's
reading of such matters was, it must be owned, confused&#8230;&#8221; [VII.1/16.172]<b><span style="color: black;"><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoEndnoteText"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>&#8220;Strether,
with his head back and his eyes on the ceiling, seemed to lose
himself&#8230;&#8221; [VI.3/15.168]<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
discussion between Strether and Mme. de Vionnet early in Book IX, the
narrator, not Strether&#8217;s mind, I think, comments: &#8220;The moment in fact
however passed, giving way to more present history&#8230;&#8221; [IX.1/22.231]<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;And that he [Strether]
was still not neglecting her [Maria] will appear from the fact that he
was with her again at the same hour on the very morrow&#8230;&#8221; [XI.2/29.290]<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In reference to Strether&#8217;s
country outing inspired by the Lambinet painting: &#8220;The adventure, it

Other examples: When Strether and Maria are sparring over his claim
that his Woollett identity is the &#8220;green cover&#8221; of his <i>Revue</i>,
she twits him as duplicitous, and the narrator comments: &#8220;Still, she
could in her own large grasp of the real condone it.&#8221; [II.1/4.55]<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Strether and Maria
are first discussing Bilham, at one point we hear of Maria: &#8220;All her
kindness wondered.&#8221; [III.2/7.81]</p>

to a typist, but I doubt it.</p>

I cannot make up my mind about exactly what is going on when, a few
times, a descriptive narrative sentence (as opposed to dialogue) begins
with a colloquial interjection, as when we are told of Bilham, during
his conversation with Strether in Gloriani&#8217;s garden, &#8220;Well, the young
man took in the scene&#8221; [V.1/10.122], or, when Chad and Strether are
discussing whom Sarah should blame, we read, &#8220;Ah but Chad, with his
completer conception of the friendly, wouldn&#8217;t quite have this!&#8221;

A similar moment occurs at the end of Book VII, when Maria (coyly)
tells Strether, &#8220;&#8216;there's a service--possible for you to render--that I
know, all the same, I shall think of&#8217;&#8221;; two lines later, the
much-knowing narrator informs us, &#8220;This, in fine, however, she would
never tell him.&#8221; [VII.3/18.198]<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
may speculate about whether she comes closest in their final dialogue,
and that it is Strether, not Gostrey, who is expected to speak the
relevant words.</p>

A couple of pages earlier, a similar locution can be argued to be more
ambiguous about its source: &#8216;Waymarsh had been for a quarter of an hour
exceptionally mute and distant, and something, or other--Strether was
never to make out exactly what&#8212;&#8230;&#8221; [I.3/3.39]<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While I find it a stretch, it is possible to argue
here that Strether himself is somehow reporting this information from
the future.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
later quote I have cited however, has even less feel of coming from
Strether, in part because it refers to both Strether and Maria, the
latter of whose entire life Strether cannot know&#8212;unless we are to take
this passage as evidence that after the end of the novel the two of
them at some point choose to spend a lifetime together.</p>

I&#8217;m reminded of John Marston&#8217;s <i>Metamorphosis of Pygmalion&#8217;s
Image </i>(1596) in which the sculptor appears to be about to
try to make love to his lifeless statue only to have the narrator
announce that whatever the reader has in mind is exactly what happens
next.</p><p class="MsoEndnoteText">One
of our book group members, Ruth Hein Schmitt, sent the following
interesting suggestion: "I have one suggestion to add to your mention
of implied liaisons among
the characters--e.g., Waymarsh and Barace. Has no one noticed that
Little Bilham is homosexual, though in the closet? &nbsp;My world, in
New
York, was replete with such young men in the 1950s and 60s: charming,
ingratiating, agreeable, wonderful friends. Their sexual encounters
were few and far between and generally disappointing, but their
compatibility with young women gave them a satisfying social life. (The
women knew the men were gay, but of course their employers and
landlords generally did not.)"</p><p class="MsoEndnoteText"><a style="" href="acad-james-ambassadors-criticism.html#_ednref33" name="_edn33" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[33]</span></span></a>
While the city functions as a kind of character in the novel, it is a
relatively limited one, even though James stresses its importance in
his preface.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
may be one of the reasons I find little interest in the plot of the
novel; Paris, as Flaubert uses it in <i>Sentimental Education</i>,
has a much more diverse, often unsettling character than we find in <i>The
Ambassadors</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>James&#8217;s
characters seem to have no interest in, say, the poor, or even
middle-class culture (if we are to classify them as middle-class, then
there is still a parallel class of Parisians with whom they have
nothing to do).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps
the frequent turmoil of the previous century alienates them and they
seek a stable view of the city where the arts and intellectualism rule
without reference to ordinary life and people.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don&#8217;t get the impression, however, that James
cares about such topics or invites us to reflect on them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dangers of Paris come,
as James mentions in his preface, from the city&#8217;s temptations to stray
from pre-defined, traditional morality and behavior&#8212;to stray from
Woollett and Milrose.</p>
</div>
<div style="" id="edn33">

<p class="MsoEndnoteText">I once commented that
Strether&#8217;s head is in Woollett and his loins in Paris, but I now think
I gave Paris too much credit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless;
Strether&#8217;s passions are certainly stimulated by Paris (or perhaps just
by being out of the U.S.; we already have hints of such feelings during
his time with Maria in England.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
whole issue of how James treats sexuality intrigues me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Is he as circumlocutious about it in other writings?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is he ever franker?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is the indirect treatment
here part of the novel&#8217;s message?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In Turgenev and Flaubert, both writing earlier and
both admired by James, it is generally quite clear what is going on
sexually.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thomas
Hardy had already published novels with little ambiguity about
sexuality.</p>
<p class="MsoEndnoteText">Perhaps because I live in
a time when sex outside marriage is taken for granted and frankness
about sexual matters is common, I can&#8217;t tell whether James&#8217;s
contemporaries would recognize a sexual reference behind his words.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For example, apparently
referring to women with whom Chad had affairs (as so often, I find it
hard to be sure), Strether thinks, &#8220;The last had been longest in
possession--in possession, that is, of whatever was left of the poor
boy's finer mortality.&#8221; [II.2/5.67]<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Is this a reference to venereal disease?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would expect not, or
else the subject would be in the background as the novel proceeds&#8212;but
the phraseology and reference to &#8220;mortality&#8221; raise the question in my
mind.</p>

I don&#8217;t have an answer to the interesting question of why James chose
this form rather than &#8220;would&#8221; + an infinitive (as in &#8220;would remember&#8221;
rather than &#8220;was to remember&#8221;).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
would also be curious to know to what degree this locution was common
at James&#8217;s time, how much James is &#8220;creating&#8221; it as narrative norm, and
whether its frequency is peculiar to <i>The Ambassadors</i>.</p>

This is another &#8220;prediction&#8221; that would be interesting to watch for on
re-reading the novel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another
knowing foreshadowing occurs when Jim Pocock delivers a heartfelt and
anguished statement of support for Chad, and the narrator reports:
&#8220;There were things in this speech that Strether let pass for the time.&#8221;
[VIII.2/20.214]<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
a future reading perhaps I would understand exactly what he &#8220;let pass&#8221;
and for how long.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Once
again the narrator seems to be announcing a future independently of
whatever is going on in Strether&#8217;s mind in the present.)</p>

The next few sentences may be the only place the novel discusses
Strether&#8217;s ability in French (they also echo <a href="musingslangandpersonality.html">a recent CIS discussion</a>
<span style="background: red none repeat scroll 0% 50%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;"></span>about
the role of language in determining one&#8217;s personality): </p>
<p class="MsoEndnoteText" style="margin-left: 0.5in;">&#8230;the
wonderful woman&#8217;s overflow of surprise and amusement was wholly into
French, which she struck him as speaking with an unprecedented command
of idiomatic turns, but in which she got, as he might have said,
somewhat away from him, taking all at once little brilliant jumps that
he could but lamely match.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
question of his own French had never come up for them; it was the one
thing she wouldn&#8217;t have permitted--it belonged, for a person who had
been through much, to mere boredom; but the present result was odd,
fairly veiling her identity, shifting her back into a mere voluble
class or race to the intense audibility of which he was by this time
inured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she
spoke the charming slightly strange English he best knew her by he
seemed to feel her as a creature, among all the millions, with a
language quite to herself, the real monopoly of a special shade of
speech, beautifully easy for her, yet of a colour and a cadence that
were both inimitable and matters of accident. [XI.4/31.311]</p>

A different confusion of tenses is: &#8220;He was to know afterwards, in the
watches of the night, that nothing would have been more open to him
than after a minute or two to propose to Chad to seek with him the
refuge of the lobby.&#8221; [III.2/7.91]<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Here, &#8220;was to know&#8221; is by now a familiar
construction; but the second part of the sentence, as James chooses to
construct it, complicates the movement of thought with a negative
(&#8220;nothing&#8221;) and can retain grammatical symmetry only by using the
conditional perfect (&#8220;would have been&#8221;).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>James&#8217;s reference two sentences later to Strether
&#8220;stuck there like a schoolboy&#8221; may suggest that this convoluted
mental-grammatical way of expression is like a school grammar exercise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would seem to me that
the sentence could be re-phrased something like, &#8220;Later he was to
realize, in the watches of the night, that Chad would have welcomed
going together to the lobby.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
offer this re-phrasing only to underscore how unnecessarily complex
Strether (not James) makes this (and most) thoughts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That, of course, is the point; my version loses
everything that Strether&#8217;s own rhetoric is meant to show us about him.</p>

For a briefer example of how James deliberately confuses antecedents,
presumably to underscore blurring between characters, try to figure out
to whom each &#8220;he&#8221; in these sentences refers: &#8220;Strether had left him
[Waymarsh] there [Strether&#8217;s bankers in the Rue Scribe] yesterday; he
wanted to see the papers, and he had spent, by what his friend could
make out, a succession of hours with the papers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He spoke of the establishment, with emphasis, as a
post of superior observation; just as he spoke generally of his actual
damnable doom as a device for hiding from him what was going on.&#8221;
[II.2/5.59]<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At one
point, James has Strether himself momentarily unsure about an
antecedent: discussing Chad&#8217;s brokering a husband for Jeanne, Mme de
Vionnet says, &#8220;&#8216;and he--our young friend--is really a combination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I quite adore him.&#8217;&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To which Strether reacts
as we might: &#8220;Strether just made sure.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>&#8216;You mean your future son-in-law?&#8217;&#8221; as opposed, of
course, to Chad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Regardless
of whom she may actually have had in mind, Mme de Vionnet reassures us:
&#8220;&#8216;Future if we all bring it off.&#8217;&#8221; [IX.1/22.238]</p>

One sentence, in the first chapter, relevant to such exploration is:
&#8220;Nothing could have been odder than Strether's sense of himself as at
that moment launched in something of which the sense would be quite
disconnected from the sense of his past and which was literally
beginning there and then.&#8221; [I.1/1.20]</p>
<p class="MsoEndnoteText">Also relevant, I think, is
the frequency of conflicting or contrasting, juxtaposed ideas and words
(e.g., &#8220;A personal relation was a relation only so long as people
either perfectly understood or, better still, didn't care if they
didn&#8217;t.&#8221; [III.2/7.92]; Miss Barrace&#8217;s striking Strether &#8220;as both
antique and modern&#8221; [VI.2/14.156]), of a character&#8217;s (usually
Strether&#8217;s) &#8220;yes&#8230;but no&#8230;&#8221; or<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;no&#8230;but
yes&#8230;&#8221; balanced phraseology (e.g., Strether thinking &#8220;But something
admonished him now that it was too late--unless indeed it were possibly
too early&#8221; [VIII.3/21.223]; Chad saying to Strether, &#8220;One doesn't know
quite what you mean by being in women's &#8216;hands.&#8217;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It's all so vague.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One is when one isn't.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One isn't when one is.&#8221; [IV.1/8.100]), of phrases
that suggest paradoxes (e.g., the oxymoron &#8220;knowing surprise&#8221;
[V.2/11.133]; the passage:&#8220;He was Lambert Strether because he was on
the cover, whereas it should have been, for anything like glory, that
he was on the cover because he was Lambert Strether&#8221; [II.2/5.62]), of
appositive phrases (e.g., &#8220;a hint to hospitality, a bid for an
invitation&#8221; [II.2/5.62]), and the like.</p>

James&#8217;s proliferation of adverbs, at least in this novel, intrigues me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Modern (late
twentieth-century) advice that I&#8217;ve learned to follow when writing
fiction is to avoid adverbs and instead seek a precise verb that will
short-circuit need for the adverb.</p>

A similar borderline point of view, even less likely to reflect
Strether&#8217;s thinking at the moment and this time not driven by an
adverb, occurs a couple of pages later when Maria Gostrey is described
as having &#8220;an alertness of action that matched her quick intelligence.&#8221;
[I.3/3.35]</p>

The words echoed are &#8220;There we are,&#8221; probably the most repeated
expression in the novel (sometimes with a different pronoun or tense of
&#8220;to be&#8221;&#8212;and at least once, &#8220;here&#8221; instead of &#8220;there&#8221;).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At first glance, the meaning seems a fatalistic
response to events, but I strongly suspect there is much more to it.</p>

lucidly objected.&#8221; [II.1/4.50]<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I

I have both read the novel and listened to a recording, sometimes one
first, sometimes the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hard
as the novel is to follow with my eyes, my ears have a tougher time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I kept replaying passages,
sometimes going back more than a page (this while I was driving and
handling a portable tape recorder).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Finally I gave up and let myself pick up what I
could.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here is what
I found: I registered snippets much of the time and missed details much
of the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But at
the most dramatic sections of the novel, my attention suddenly focused,
at least for awhile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
still sometimes rewound segments where I <i>wanted</i>
precise details, but I was no longer doing so obsessively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This suggests to me that
the novel <i>does </i>have compelling plot moments,
despite my boredom with its subjects, but that much of the novel is
indeed an intellectual puzzle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
keep wondering where James found enough of an audience to make a living
as an author, and whether he would have financial success today (aside
from being the subject of numerous college classrooms).</p>

I don&#8217;t know what parallel technology or cultural phenomenon might have
inspired James, and I am not assuming there was any<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Were I to expand this study, I would look into the
history of photography to see if anything popped out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(I think also of the stereopticon and the magic
lantern.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The still
camera had been around for some decades&#8212;think of all the Civil War
photos we have&#8212;and at least people with money commissioned portraits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have the impression that
photographic portrait studios were available to the public, but that
cameras were not in general use until some decades after James wrote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first motion pictures,
still novelties, were being created around the time James was composing
this novel (think of the Lumière brothers), but I have no reason to
think he ever saw any of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Although,
since he lived in London and Paris and moved with the intelligentsia,
perhaps he did.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
doubt zoom lenses existed.</p>
<p class="MsoEndnoteText">Given the prevalence of
professional portrait photography and the affluence of the class of
people James depicts, it may be worth considering why photography does <i>not
</i>appear in any way in the novel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would seem ready-made for his thematic content
and imagery, but James sticks to painting.</p>

Our book group took up this topic, and Adeline R. Tintner includes a
persuasive chapter on the subject, &#8220;Holbein's <i>The
Ambassadors: </i>A Pictorial Source for <i>The Ambassadors</i>,&#8221;

James makes this claim in the first chapter of his introduction to the
novel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I say
&#8220;claim&#8221; because (a) author&#8217;s are notorious for misleading readers, and
more importantly (b) authors are not always conscious of all that they
are doing as they write.</p>

I might equally have thought of Shakespeare&#8217;s forest settings,
especially in Loves Labors Lost with its alienation from women, that
are impossible contemplative retreats from the active life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I did so only after

I don&#8217;t know anything about acting technique around 1900, and perhaps
the nuances to which I refer here were unconveyed before the advent of
Stanislavsky and his successors.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Mom
told me that I was the ugliest baby she had ever seen&#8211;hairy and dark and
covered with a caul, so ugly that she could have chahlished aveck.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
was born on October 24, 1918, on Twenty-First Street between First and Second
Avenues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't think it was in a
hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In my infant year I was
rescued from a fire and my father got into a fight with three Tahlyehners and
beat the hell out of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was told
this by experiencers who remembered, but are long gone.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
own parti-colored memories begin when I was about four.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was King of the May in some early spring
festival.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I and my Queen, undoubtedly a
young and charming female four-year-old, held hands and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>led a group of young children in a file of
two's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm pretty sure that my brother,
Hy, who was three years older than I, was in my entourage somewhere in the
rear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course I had to hold my
mother's hand in my dependency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can
imagine that this may have been the beginning of my enjoyment in taking center
stage.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">At
about the age of six I remember lying on a broad bed next to my father, who was
reading <i>The Toilers of the Sea</i> by Victor Hugo, and feeling like
cuddling, but being ignored.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could
read at a pretty early age&#8211;well, maybe not read, but decipher letters and put
them together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps my mother was
having a baby, maybe Abie, the youngest, who was six years younger than I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I lay looking at the cracks in the bedroom
wall sculpting shapes of animals, faces, demons in my fancy.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
father fried something, I know; perhaps eggs, and didn't do too good a
job.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also stood up and peed in the
kitchen sink.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was born in Roumania
and came to the U.S. when he was about eighteen plus or minus five or six, I
guess.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother and he were married
before 1915 and he was twenty-four at that time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He may have come to the Goldeneh Landt as early as 1905.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I figure he was about twenty-eight years
older than I, which means he was born about 1890; my mother, a year earlier.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Except
for Abie, all the kids were born in October: Hy, in 1915 on the tenth; I, as
already noted; Sinkie, the family tragedy, in 1921 on the seventh; and Mink and
Irving, in 1923 on the 26th.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rhythm
was probably broken by my parents' separations, which occurred with increasing
frequency between children, so that Abie was born on March, 15, 1925.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Somehow I came to understand that minor
quarrels led to major quarrels which led to ascending lengths of departure by
my adulterous parent and each of his apologetic returns heralded a new
impregnation, a new birth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How joyous
the triumphant male who marries a fertile woman!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How vulnerable is the vessel!</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
don't remember my mother's birthday or my father's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't think I ever knew them, or their wedding
anniversary&#8211;small loss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Adults didn't
have birthdays that needed remembering in those days.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
don't know where my father learned his trade of fur nailer, but he was an
activist in the fur union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was a
very close friend of the leaders of the fur union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He'd boast that during the struggles to establish the union he
had actually slept in the same bed with Ben Gold, the heroic president.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The battles against the gangsters led by
Louie Buckwalter, who was hired by the fur bosses, were fought with fists and
pipes and knives and guns and the cops were on the side of the gangsters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the Union won out, I know, but how, I
don't know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I guess loyalty and
generalship won over hirelings.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
father never spoke of any injuries he received, but he told me once how he and
a comrade named Menscher, a giant of a man, would go into a scab shop and intimidate
the boss and his workers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They didn't
use weapons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father was a
"Shtarker," a big, strong man&#8211;what the anti-union press called a
goon.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Sometimes
he would reminisce about the Old Country.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A piece of herring, an onion and some rye bread would suffice him, he
would say, as he made his brief for his generation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a stronger and wiser generation than mine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Who can tell when memory bows to wished-for
beliefs and who can blame a little fanciful editing of facts?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How can I question that when he was five he
was teaching children twice his age their alef, baises?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Given the opportunity and moral and
financial support there's no telling what a great scholar he might have become.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Roumania was not fertile ground for the
aspirations of Jews.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a
far-away look on his face when he spoke about the might-have-been in his
dreams.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
mother was born in "Kovna, Gebehrnia."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was in Lithuania and I have an impression that it's not
exactly a location, more a locale, a county.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That's just my conjecture.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Gebehrnia" may mean "born in" and Kovna may be a
large area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know that every time I
meet a Lithuanian Jew and say my mother was from Kovna, Gebehrnia, they smile
as though witnessing a heavenly place or time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don't know why, because my mother would tell me about how she would
have to hide from the Cossacks during pogroms.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don't remember details, though the general picture in my mind is a lot
more devastating than the one presented in <i>Fiddler on the Roof</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In my mind's eye there are bloody and
contorted faces filled with fear, bent backs, eyes staring into blackness&#8211;no
heroes&#8211;or perhaps all heroes.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Like
all mothers, mine was beautiful, and I have pictures to prove it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In one she is seated on an ornately carved
chair with her hair piled high on her head and falling in rich, heavy locks to
below her hips.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She's wearing a white,
lacy dress and her skin is pure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have
some pictures of her in a form-hiding bathing suit posing with other young
girls and occasionally with my father.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Mom
read the Jewish Daily Forward and occasionally the Freiheit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also read books.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know that Jewish boys were educated in the
Talmud Torah, but I don't know where girls got their education.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those that did must have struggled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She loved Sholem Aleichem's stories, and I
think her bias was a bit to the left of the Forward's "Jews shouldn't be
noticed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They should behave themselves
and keep quiet about injustices."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
mother worked as a sewing machine operator before her marriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Working conditions must have colored her
attitude.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father must have
influenced her also.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was a furrier,
a member of one the most red-baited unions around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never did learn about her wedding and whether her nine brothers
and sisters attended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her mother must
have.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">While
my father lived with us, we moved to and in the Bronx several times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was Brook Avenue, a Hundred and Sixty
Third Street, St. Anne's Avenue&#8211;especially St. Anne's Avenue where we lived on
the ground floor in front.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You walked
up about four stone steps that were placed equidistantly between two large
windows of two separate apartments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
lived in one of the apartments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think
I was six, maybe a year older&#8211;it's hard to pick time's snarls apart.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
had a healthy curiosity as a child.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When my mother took me to register for first grade, the enrollment desk
was down in the physical training area which was marked off with white squares
and had basketball hoops on the high walls.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I became intrigued by the water fountains.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tried to figure out how they worked and while my mother was
talking to the clerk, I knelt down on my hands and knees to investigate the
underworkings of a fountain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Ehr
cookt vee der feece vackst," (He looks to see where the feet grow from) she
would say with a mixture of pride and exasperation later on in my life.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
was absorbed in <i>The Adventures of Woody Woodchuck</i> and Reddy Fox was
ready to pounce, when my mother interrupted me.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Eddaleh,
a girl wants to talk to you."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"A
girl? What!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To say the least I
was disconcerted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had no idea about
those creatures, outside of my sisters, and I very hesitantly went to the
door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a girl about my age with
whom I had a very passing acquaintance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She lived in one of the rear apartments on our floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her family was German and they were
celebrating Christmas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I followed her
hesitantly and was not really greeted by the family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a wonderful looking tree, all green and silver, wide and
tall and beneath its lower branches were variously shaped colored boxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps my embarrassment kept me form
feeling welcome.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I left soon after my
inviter offered me a cookie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't
know if "Thank you," was part of my vocabulary then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I paid for that cookie for years when my
family teased me about my "girl friend."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was a blusher at least from then on into<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my dotage.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Time
jumps, skips, and falls back upon itself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My mother gave me a half-dollar to buy some groceries, and I put on some
roller skates which were probably Hy's and awkwardly stumbled and rolled past
my grammar school, PS 38, which had a metal grillwork fence along its front,
clutching this precious half-dollar in my sweaty fist, when adventure
struck!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I suddenly found myself pushed
against the fence by two young would-be thieves who demanded my money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Desperately and thoughtlessly I pushed them
aside and clopped back the way I'd come and they never caught me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know I babbled to my mother about my
terrible ordeal and I can't remember if she made the proper fuss over me, but I
felt a bit heroic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think I was eight.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">(I
saw my first cotton boll then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
an Amazement!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cotton was a plant that
grew!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had seeds!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't know where it came from, but it
happened that same night.)</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Another
Christmas, I think it was an earlier one, Hy and I were staring into a
bookstore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We must have looked like a
couple of Hugo's gamins or Dickens' street urchins, because an adult (Who knows
how old?) tapped us on the shoulders, brought us into the store and told us to
choose books.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I chose <i>Adventures of
Peter Rabbit</i> by Thornton W. Burgess, which became the first taste I had of
the wonderful world of Nature that existed in books.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I once knew which book Hy got, but I've forgotten.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't know if we thanked the man.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
brother was an omniverous reader and affected my choices strongly, except I
don't believe he ever cared for the Peter Rabbit and Mother West Wind
stories.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was a Frank and Dick
Merriwell reader.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dick was the younger
brother and obviously my favorite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
times I think the Merriwell boys destroyed me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The author, Burt L. Standish, made them so totally heroic, morally and
physically, that in trying to copy them I became so critical of what they
thought was evil that I adopted<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a
Victorian outlook on life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't use
a four letter word freely until years after I was married.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I went to the Civilian Conservation
Corps the fellow used to laugh at the way I said fuck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was unnatural on my tongue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It became natural eventually, but I'm still
a bit shocked when today's women curse in front of me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I grew up a prude.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">When
Hy was ten and I was seven, he received a gift from my mother's sister, Aunt
Helen, and her husband, Uncle Julius, from Rockford, Illinois.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a set of ten books called <i>The Wit
and Humor of America</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><a name="dadtheater1"></a>Among the
stories and anecdotes were numerous poems that I used to either read or sing
aloud while lying on the floor in our various kitchens.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The linoleum became more cracked and torn
and discolored as we moved downward to lower and lower rents as money grew
scarcer, but I got such pleasure out of what I was doing that I could have been
on the stage of a theater.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
pastime, which lasted into my teens, started when that wonderful set
arrived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I still recite and sing poems
aloud.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
father's good looks and his involvement in union activities gave him an
opportunity for<span style="">&nbsp; </span>several adulterous
relationships.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once, as a cover-up, he
sent the family to a place called Rubel's Farm House, some distance from the
city.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother dressed in
pepper-and-salt knickers, I remember.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was old enough to fall in love, and I did, madly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I fell in love with the World of Nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I sniffed at the watermelony odor on the
fresh peeled bark of apple trees, I thrilled at seeing tadpoles in an old
discarded bathtub, I was enthralled at the sight of udders squeezed, the hiss
of milk jetting into a bucket, the taste of strained, warm milk right from the
cow, the country fields, the trees, the skies, the stars ...the Wonder!</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
higher the rise, the more precipitous the fall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The quarrels had always been loud and long and I remember
shrinking in fear and wincing when my father hit my mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This one reached the zenith as suspicion
became certainty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We children huddled
together as my mother wept hysterically and swept glassware and potteryware
from the top of the china closet and bureau.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I still remember the boy and girl china dolls that were each over a foot
tall smashing, their hollow insides of white plaster contrasting with their
vividly colored red and blue exteriors.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I remember my mother sitting on a trunk that just fitted into a kind of
alcove, with us children clinging to her as she wept.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was eight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think that
was the last time I saw my father as a member of our household.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I imagine a slamming of a door and a
whimpering.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
used to pick up items of information from my mother's conversations with her
friends, Sophie Diamond, Gussie (both unmarried), and Sophie Schlachter,
another deserted wife, but she only had one child, a daughter, and a husband
whose support payments were regular.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I'd lie on the floor reading and not really paying attention until their
voices dropped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother complained
that my father would leave her each time after he made her pregnant; she would
forgive him when he returned, become pregnant again, and the cycle would repeat
itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eventually there was no more
forgiveness left.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">One
of the last times my father and mother had a physical disagreement we children
were sent to spend some time (perhaps only one night) with my father's mother:
Bubbah is what we called her and she was a stern, unsmiling woman as I remember
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't remember if Zayda was
alive, but his presence was evident in the stern, unsmiling face that stared
down from the large framed picture that hung on the wall.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
Aunt Rose Waldman, my father's older sister, was having the same trouble with
her husband as my mother was having with hers and her children were also being
given sanctuary at the same time we were.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I have the impression that Bubbah was unhappy with my mother because my
mother had dumped us on her.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
had my first sexual experience that night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was B.M. (before the Merriwells).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Beds were at a premium and I slept with Aunt Rose's daughters in a
pretty tight fit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was Florence,
who was about a year older than I, and Dorothy, about my age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I strove to lie as far as possible from
Florence but was finally seduced by the loveliness of her bare eight-year-old
shoulder and, ever-so-delicately, driven by pre-adolescent lust, I sneakily
pressed my lips for an incandescent moment on that smoothest of all surfaces
and quickly turned away.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Bubbah's
children were my Aunt Rose, whose husband deserted her; my father, Louis; my
Aunt May, who was married to Uncle Dave, a wily pinochler, who had to be
watched; and my Uncle Irving, the rich Yanowitz, became Young along with his
wife, Aunt Etta, when their son, Martin, became a CPA.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Aunt
Rose had three children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was
Eddie, who was two years older than Hy, which made him five years older than I
was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was a kind of bigger bigger
brother and I liked him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then Florence,
who was always pleasant and supportive, and Dorothy, who was a ravishing
beauty.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Eddie
was quite a womanizer when he was young and the pleasures of the pursuit never
left him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mae and I went to the wedding
of another Eddie, the son of our closest friends when we were poultry farmers,
the Kaisers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The wedding took place in
Boston; and on the way home I decided to call Eddie Waldman, who lived in
Providence, Rhode Island.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
were invited over with warmth, met his wife and daughter, given a strong
suggestion that we move to Providence because Eddie was so lonely and
incidentally were informed about how easy it was to screw the poor schmucks
that bought furniture at his store, mostly "niggers."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were persuaded to buy what they
couldn't afford<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and when they couldn't
pay the installments Eddie would repossess the items and keep the payments so
that the poorer the slob, the greater the rooking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eddie chortled as he told me this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was all a big joke and very profitable.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">He
had a lovely daughter of about sixteen and a very hospitable, charming
wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seemed like a happy family
until Eddie drew me aside and confided, "You get tired of any hole after
awhile."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Coward that I was, I
could only smile weakly.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">He
told me of some of his conquests when he canvassed down South for The Gotham
Premium Novelty Company which was owned by my Uncle Irving and his junior
partner, Sokoloff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eddie was part of a
crew that would stop at a mill town and go from door to door to try to persuade
the worker's wives to sell chances from pullbooks to their neighbors and
friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The winner and the seller
would get chenille bedspreads and the losers would get small items like razor
blades, toothpaste, perfumes; all very cheap stuff, but enticing to the poor
mill worker's wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eddie was good at
selling and even better at seducing, to hear him tell it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His hyperactive hormones, untempered by
love, led him to follow in his father's footsteps and my father's example.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He strayed too far and too often and
eventually embraced singlehood again.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
father was the chief of one of the crews and made a good living from it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He couldn't work in New York City, because
he was constantly delinquent in his support payments and my mother would have
him picked up and thrown into a jail cell.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">One
of his crew members was Jean, whom I eventually discovered was my
stepmother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was thirty-two when I
met her; my father, forty-six; I, seventeen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don't know when they got married and I don't know why it bothered me
that it must have been before my mother died.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was never formally introduced to Jean.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When it finally hit me, I was tremendously upset, got stinking
drunk and babbled to my friends, Sammy and Benny, who tried to comfort me&#8211;for I
don't know what.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Eddie's
sister, Florence, married a chicken broker, Oscar, who was very pleasant and
phlegmatic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dorothy married a rich man,
Murray Cohen, who was a practicing lawyer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He gave up his practice to take over his father's immensely successful
children's clothing factory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he
was about fifty, he returned to law.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Returning
from one of the funerals that the family attended, Aunt Rose was killed in an
automobile accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dorothy drove the
car.</p>

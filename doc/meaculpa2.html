<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
father left and money left with him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mom moved us down to the East Side between Second and Third Avenues to
71 East Fourth Street, first floor front.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I think the Jews were in the majority on East Fourth in 1926.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a mix&#8211;Poles, Irish, Italians, an
occasional black&#8211;Hungarians, Lithuanians, Galicians, Russians, Germans&#8211;Czeck
and double-check Americans.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">There
was a kid pitching pennies at a sidewalk crack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was curious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"What
do you do?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He explained whoever
got the coin closest to the crack won.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I only had one coin, a quarter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My mother's youngest brother, Uncle Willie, had visited us and was
generous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I pitched the quarter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I lost.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Spector, that was the SOB's name took it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I protested in vain.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That's the way you play the game.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I've played it a lot since then.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Never did learn how to win.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">There
were several meeting halls on the block and on Yom Kippur, one that was devoted
to services allowed poor kids to enter for free.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was very boring, listening to the dahvening and standing and sitting
and turning to the East, and my friends and I never stayed long.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"You
sinned!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was a sin!" Sammy or
Benny would say.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would be a bit
nonplussed because there were so many sins a Jewish boy could commit when he
was amusing himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You couldn't tear
paper, you couldn't carry anything, you couldn't think about girls, you
couldn't eat at all or you couldn't eat trayf when you did eat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were always pitfalls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On Pesach don't eat Chumitzdich and don't
eat in a Goy's house and make sure it's kosher whatever you eat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On a field day when I was in sixth grade, I
brought a sandwich for lunch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
sandwich!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was hungry; a friend
offered another; I ate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meat with
grease on it?<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Butter!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Oy what a sin!</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">God
punished me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was in a hundred yard dash
and He convinced me that I should reserve my speed until the finish the same
way Frank Merriwell did in his mile runs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was so far behind I came in last in the next race.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
went to Chedar on Fifth Street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
learned to mumble as fast as I could, words I didn't understand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eventually I learned the Hebrew for pen and
pencil and man and woman and that was about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were classmates (only boys) who mumbled so fast I wouldn't
have understood what they said if I could have understood what they said.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went to Shul and tried to dahven, but
always needed the help of some Tahless-garbed elder, who without ceasing his
genuflecting, would patiently flip the pages of the sidder and point to the
correct place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon as he turned
around I'd be lost.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">As
a scholar I didn't shine, but when it came to recitations in Hebrew, I was
It.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I always got a fountain pen at
Channukah.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Rebbe would Kvell over
me and comment about how well I expressed the meaning of The Holy Writ.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
loved the Bible stories and I loved and feared God and was eventually
bar-mitzvahed and ribbed my left arm with the tight tvilim and bowed to the
East and my intentions were honorable, but like New Year Resolutions quickly
undone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was a graduate Jew, qualified
to be part of a minyan, but not prepared to affirm my Jewishness, and quite
willing to let it lapse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
considered a Goy by the orthodox Jews, but that word was bandied about by them
as much as Jew Bastard was bandied about by too, too many otherwise sensible
humans.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Manhattan
Center was used for union meetings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
cellar establishment next to it was used as a distribution center for Eskimo
Pies&#8211;no bicycle carts in those days; the vendors pushed them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When a cake of the solid carbon dioxide that
was used to keep the pies frozen broke we kids would snatch pieces and have fun
watching the marvel of ice boiling in water and giving off clouds of
steam.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We'd juggle pieces from one hand
to the other just quickly enough not to get a frost burn.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">There
was a broad, tall (five stories, at least) building where Steinway pianos were
either stored or manufactured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we
grew older we boys would try to throw rubber balls onto its roof from the
street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Benny, who was two years older
and six inches shorter than I, could do it; I couldn't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were two candy stores across the
street from each other and we kids used to play cards on the benches that were
set out by the storekeepers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We played
brisk, casino, poker&#8211;no money, we had none.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The benches were usually safe to sit on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we played games like Ringalevio, Three Feet Across,
punchball, or stoopball, a bag of garbage might come rocketing down and either
hit or spray us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It wasn't exactly like
The Middle Ages because these building actually had toilets on the inside&#8211;with
Running water!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Of course, they were in
the hall.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's embarrassing when a
faulty lock allows the door to be yanked open by the girl next door at a very
unpropitious time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this was not The
Girl Next Door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She just lived there.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Similarities
existed though.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We moved downwards
socially and economically from 71 to 69, 57 and eventually, 60 East Fourth, a
model of the tenement pits. I was about thirteen when we moved to the third
floor front in 57.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This building was
about the fifth from the corner of Third Avenue (The Bowery) where drunks
curled up in doorways or lay in the gutters dead to the world.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had graduated to my own bed, an army cot
that was set up in the kitchen.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
had gone to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was awakened by
what sounded like raindrops hitting the floor, occasionally hitting me, but
they weren't wet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stood on the cot
and reached up to pull the string which turned on the light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't see it but I could feel it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the light went on "Iss hut
gevorren finster in mine aygen."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The ceiling, the walls, the floor, the cot and I were covered with
cockroaches.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The light drove them
away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't turn it off when I went
back to sleep.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Poverty
declared war on us and we fought back.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the battle against roaches we rimmed the baseboard of the kitchen and
the cracks around the sink and bathtub with the blue of Copper Sulphate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was spread behind the coal stove and ice
box.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bedsprings were tilted so that
a corner was over a large schissel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Boiling water was poured on the corners to strike the bloated bedbugs
dead&#8211;bloated with our blood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I enjoyed
killing those flat, red bugs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
would hide in the thinnest crevice, but Mom was indomitable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eventually we stopped waking up and finding
our sheets smeared with our blood.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
heard the rats, but didn't see them until one night a day or so before
Halloween.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Driven by a creative urge, I
used the enamel-topped kitchen table to draw with crayons my Halloween
oeuvre.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a backyard fence
similar to the one Tom Sawyer had tightroped, with a cat perched upon it, a
giant half moon with a witch on a broomstick flying between the horns,
squiggles that looked like bats&#8211;and I was just filling in colors when what to
my wondering eyes appeared?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
drainpipe that jutted out of the cracked and broken wall, placidly staring at
me insolently, lounged a gross ugliness gnawing on a garbage scrap: A rat!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I grew paralyzed, then frantic, and then
coolly I threw my crayons at it, I took off a shoe and threw that, I threw a
book at it, I bounced the table; and I conquered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It sauntered back to the vile depths from whence it sprung.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I dared it, but it wouldn't come back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My first windmill.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
contributed to the animal life in the apartment, but no vermin!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A garter snake escaped from a thread I used
as a leash and scared my poor mother out of her wits when it suddenly appeared
from a floor cupboard and skittered to some remote place of safety (probably
where the rats were).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I loosed a horde
of small snapping turtles in the backyard.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I transported a nest of blind, pink baby mice into our apartment, but
they soon starved without a mother's love.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A tenement backyard is not like a suburban one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It lies at the bottom of a canyon of crowded
buildings festooned with rusting fire-escapes, numberless clotheslines and
staggered, what we called, "telephone poles" but were poles used only
for clothes line reels strung from the fire-escape to the pole.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were also toads and frogs in the
apartment as the tadpoles reached maturity.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
started catching and keeping water creatures by the time I was twelve.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 69 East Fourth I kept them in a
five-gallon butter can on the fire escape among my flora which grew in an
orange crate:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Poison Ivy, Virginia Creeper,
thorny bushes&#8211;whatever had roots....toadstools, mushrooms...</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">It
grew cold in the winter and a film of ice developed over my aquarium of
sunnies, cabomba and anacharis, but I wasn't worried because Hy told me that
fish were cold-blooded creatures and ice couldn't harm them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ice grew thicker and my faith in my
brother's advice waned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was sure that
the aquarium was a solid block of ice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In a panic I lugged the can in and placed it in the sink.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was quite a heavy load.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since they were cold-blooded creatures and
couldn't feel anything, my experimental nature demanded that I discover what
was hidden in the mysterious, beckoning translucence of the ice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I watched the hot water dig deeply into the
thick slab and felt rather than saw an object zzzooom past me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Flapping on the floor was a dying
sunny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A successful experiment:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I learned that fish can die in hot water!</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My<span style="">&nbsp; </span>mother was a dressmaker and worked in a
sweatshop on Twenty-eighth Street and Sixth Avenue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She used to walk to work and back in order to save the Third
Avenue trolley carfare, a nickel each way.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I used to do a lot of the housework and the cooking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mom would prepare the food and put it in the
icebox.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I came home from school, I
would heat it and add whatever needed to be added; onion, celery, and cut-up
potatoes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it was a soup I would
bring it to a boil, skim off the scum, (Mom called it, "Sahm."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said it was poison.) and turn down the
flame so that the soup would simmer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There were other directions for stews, and tzimmus, and chuck steak
fried in onions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would kosher the
meat by sprinkling it with Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt, rinse it when I was
supposed to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It saved my mother a
little work and I guess it made her a little happy when she dragged herself
home from a piece-work factory after at least an eight-hour day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never counted.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">On
Fridays I'd scrub the kitchen floor&#8211;no mop&#8211;hands and knees and bucket, brush
and rag.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On some other day I'd remove
the enamel top that covered the bathtub (which was in the kitchen) and I'd try
to wash the clothes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I used a washboard
for scrubbing, I think I soaked the white clothes in a bleach for a while, but
I don't think I ever enjoyed that job.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I climbed the "telephone poles" to attach the clothes line
reels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could cling very well.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
washtub was our bathtub too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day
Sophie Schlachter and her daughter, Rose, came visiting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was washing off my weekly deposit of filth
when Mom opened the kitchen-hall door exposing my all which I dunked in
panic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The water was opaque with dirt
so I guess my pride was hidden, but I blushed from root to topmost branch.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Hy
was never called "Hy" by his friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was always "Yonny."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don't know why I never was.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The closest I came to a nickname was "Snake."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was because Sammy, Benny and I were
interested in snakes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sammy was
"Fangs," Benny was "Poison," and I was "Snake."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Hy
was always a social creature; he knew everyone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If I accompanied him on a walk from Fourth Street to Fourteenth
Street along Second Avenue, we couldn't take ten steps without his greeting
someone or being greeted&#8211;and the greetings would extend to from ten minutes to
forever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It bored me to death, but I
was kind of proud of his social prowess.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Of course, I envied him too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was the good-looking one and I didn't know anybody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Personality counts, I guess.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was a member of an active club at the Stuyvesant Neighborhood House,
called The Jubilos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They put on shows,
they wrote skits, were very strongly anti-fascist, anti-nazi and Hy loved it.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">He
was treasurer for a while and spent the fifteen dollar treasury on something he
wanted and was unfortunately asked to account before he could make good.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother made good.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">There
was a time when for some reason or other Hy and I were the only ones at
home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother was probably in the
hospital at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Somehow we woke
up late and Hy suggested we go to Broadway and see some movies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some money had come into the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We spent the day seeing five Broadway movies
plus vaudeville.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think I was fourteen
at the time and not as yet used to playing hooky, but it was absolutely wonderful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think we saw <i>Broadway Melody of 1932</i>
and I don't remember what else.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Movies
were a nickel and I loved them and I started stealing nickels from my mother's
pocketbook, later dimes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't know
if she ever suspected anything, but she was no dope. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>She never made an issue of it, though.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">When
Eddie Cantor was very popular and we had no radio, I begged my mother to buy
one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I sold her on the idea by
promising not to go to the movies&#8211;I wouldn't have to, and we could listen to
all kinds of things and "Please, Momma, please, I promise on my word!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I promise, I promise, I promise!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few days after I had given up, an eight
tube Atwater Kent was delivered to the house.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
kept my promise&#8211;for about three days, but Sunday night after Cantor sang
"I Love To Spend This Hour With You," I begged my mom to give me a
dime&#8211;it cost that much at night&#8211;so that I could go see a picture I just
couldn't miss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She gave it to me.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
started to "watch cars" outside the Loew's Commodore on Sixth Street
and Second Avenue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was an
exceptionally naive child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
really a racket.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>People with cars were
often afraid of what the watcher might do if turned down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wasn't that good at it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd never have made a cop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tried to keep kids from sitting on the
fenders of my charges, but it was a tough neighborhood and there were tough
kids around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wasn't one of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nobody ever attacked me, but I didn't give
out many chances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes one of my
customers would have to call my attention to the fact that he was pulling
away!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>People were nice generally and
I'd get a nickel or a dime&#8211;sometimes a quarter, and once a whole half-dollar&#8211;or
did I dream it?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd bring home money to
my mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd buy the kids stocking
fillers at Christmas time and I'd tell them stories that they begged for.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">That
was my Dr. Jekyll side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was very
vicious to my younger brothers and sisters.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I cowed them with my gestapo tactics.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I'd say, "Shut up!" and lash out at them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hy would whack me once in a while&#8211;too often,
though I suspect he was trying to be the father we lacked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day I became so angry at him that I hid
behind the kitchen door (that was the entrance to our railroad flat) and I
socked him in the face when he came in.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He grabbed me; he was strong, but I was no weakling, only a coward, I guess.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It became a wrestling match.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember punching futilely at his stomach
and I don't remember the upshot.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
mother, in desperation, appealed to the school authorities because of my rotten
behavior.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was interviewed by a
psychologist(?) I think. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>She sat and
stared at me and asked me an occasional question and referred me to the
Vanderbilt Neurological Institute, which was on 168th Street and Amsterdam
Avenue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, a man who doodled
throughout the time I spent with him, sometimes stared at me, but I don't
recall him asking me any questions and I continued beating up my sisters and
brothers.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
ever-alert imagination led me to some really interesting sadisms.<span style="">&nbsp;<a name="meaculpa2_irving_and_abie"></a></span>Irving was older than Abie, but much more
sensitive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Abie was a tough little
son-of-a-bitch and would take no crap from anyone, except me, because I was
still too big to whip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would force
the two of them to fight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Abie would
kill Irving, though Irving would try to cope with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd egg them on as Irving's tears flowed,
force him to stand and take it, till he'd be on the verge of collapsing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would hold up Abie's hand, declare him the
winner, and, I think, make them shake hands.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Abie
wouldn't let anyone harm Irving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
really loved each other and I loved them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I guess they were toys to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
remember one night I was home alone and I heard them coming up the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned out the light in the kitchen,
opened the door about six inches and, forming a claw with my hand, I held it so
that they would see it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were
gabbing away until they both shrieked in fear and, screaming, ran from the
monstrous hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Laughing uproariously,
but a little frightened myself, I caught<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>them both, one encircled by each of my arms, and comforted them until
they quieted down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I really was a
dangerous lunatic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I once slapped Mink
on the side of the head and she quivered in shock for what could only have been
seconds, but seemed an eternity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
frightened then.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
mother would try to hit me sometimes in order to punish me for hitting the
kids.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day she came at me with the
broom, and in order to avoid her I crawled under the bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She poked at me with the straw end as hard
as she could and I tried to avoid being hit by pushing at it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The wooden end hit her in the face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She dropped the broom and clutched at her
eye with a cry of pain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I scrambled out
from under the bed apologizing profusely.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"I'm
sorry, Mom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't mean it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mom, I'm sorry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Please, Mom, please," I cried, and I was crying, feeling her
pain, hating myself, blaming myself, begging, but she turned from me and left
the bedroom.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
didn't know what to do with myself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
couldn't stay in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ran
downstairs and started to walk uptown along Third Avenue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think it was my self-pity that carried me
along and after a few blocks I decided that I would run away from home and
never come back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a nickel, and I
could have taken the subway to Van Cortlandt Park at 242nd Street in the Bronx,
but I decided to walk it and save the nickel for food.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My resolve petered out at 125th Street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could either buy a hot dog and keep on
walking or I could take the subway back home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I did neither.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I took the subway
to Van Cortlandt Park, still determined never to go back home.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Van
Cortlandt Park was my favorite place in the whole world.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was where I found all the woodland
creatures that I would bring back home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pond snails, little shiners, sunnies, killies, dragon fly larvae,
mosquito wrigglers, field mice, toads, frogs, garter snakes and all kinds of
plants and bugs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I walked in swampland
among skunk cabbage plants, found bird nests and stood so quietly watching a
flicker feed its young in a hole in a hollow tree that a chipmunk ran between
my legs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was my wonderworld.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
subway became the elevated in the Bronx and the first place one saw when
entering Van Cortlandt Park was a formal garden that was laid out as a
rectangle about two hundred by four hundred feet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The perimeter was a path about eight feet wide made up of crushed
stone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Three or four canals about the
same width as the path and fed by water from the large lake that was hidden by
a railway abutment ran the length of the garden and fed off each other by
connecting canals that were about forty feet apart.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You crossed each canal via a short, wooden bridge that led you by
a crushed stone path directly to the next canal with its wooden bridge and so
on and on.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
water was filled with various forms of aquatic life; I remember huge Japanese
snails, goldfish, carp, minnows and plants that made this budding naturalist a
lawbreaker.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nobody ever seemed to care
if I pillaged this treasure-house, but I felt like a daring thief when I
collected rich stores for my aquarium at home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I had a ten gallon glass one with a metal frame now, that I had paid
only $2.99 for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The salesman had proved
his faith in its construction by turning it upside down and standing on its
slate bottom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He weighed over two
hundred.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Today
the sky was gray as I trudged determinedly along the path and over the bridges,
under the railroad abutment and across from the lake to the hill that led by
precarious paths up to my own fairyland.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To others' eyes it may have appeared a desert land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was sparsely covered by weeds because of
the gravelly soil sprinkled with scattered rocks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On my first foray here I discovered tiny creatures which I
thought at first were grasshoppers, but when I caught one I discovered they
were tiny toads.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When one slipped under
a rather sizeable rock, I heaved, and discovered my first garter snake.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Another
time a flip of a rock revealed five tiny, blind baby mice and two courageous
adults who gave me some insight into what daring deeds love, (or instinct?)
could lead to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One can admire a mouse
when it dashes bravely under the heel of a monster person to snatch its baby by
the scruff of the neck and skitter away.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Each parent dashed in turn.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their furs were colored differently; one a rich golden brown and the
other a sleek black.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
generous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I allowed them to rescue
three of their litter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other two I
placed in my shirt pocket.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Somehow they
crawled out on the subway ride home, but I caught them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tried to keep them alive, but they died
and I threw them in the garbage next morning.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">But
that was long ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tilted no rocks
today; I saw no fairyland.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I trudged
dismally ahead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt pangs of hunger,
but I throttled them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sky grew
dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not night as yet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The darkness was caused by thunderheads and
soon the first heavy drops fell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
a summer's day and a summer storm and I gave up my resolution quickly under the
pelting, turned and headed home.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
had probably only gone about a mile past my hilltop and when I reached it, I
was dumbfounded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Niagara Falls had come
to Van Cortlandt Park.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Water cascaded
down the ravine-like paths and I slid and coasted to the bottom of that
thousand-mile hill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no
discernible lake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where I had walked on
dry land and the macadam of the auto roadway, I now waded in water at least a
foot and a half deep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I had to
walk under the railroad abutment, the water came to my waist and when I came to
the first wooden bridge, I found it floating on a level with my chest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The designers of the garden had tethered
them so they couldn't float away.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Wearily, I pulled myself up on it, walked its length, dropped off,
walked to the next and the next again and again until finally I was through the
garden and sloshing up the elevated steps.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
didn't know what to do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were a
couple of people at the change booth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
looked at the exit doors, thought about sneaking onto the station platform,
decided against it, and got on line.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When my turn came, my tongue stumbled over itself.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"I
duntaveanymoney buhcoodyalemmegotrue. . ."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
stationmaster glared at me and brusquely motioned me to get away from the
window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I started to plead again, but
he shook his head vigorously and indicated that I should move aside.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My spirit was defeated, and I withdrew and
stood feeling forlorn and hopeless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was a cold, hungry, shivering wreck.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Oh, how I yearned for home!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was just a few yards from freedom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All
I had to do was to yank open an exit door and dash down the platform to the
train in the station.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That's all I had
to do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He couldn't follow me, but what
if?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What if he called a conductor?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I gave up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I just stood there in a blank fog.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">And
then someone was holding my hand and pressing something into my palm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stared.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was a coin: a dime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked
up and found myself looking into the wrinkled face of a little old woman, who,
without saying a word, smiled and went through the turnstile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stared after her; I looked at the dime; I
lifted my head and saw that she was entering an elevated car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ran forward to say something, the door to
the car closed, the train started to move.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
stood frozen for a moment, looked at the dime again and whispered,
"Thanks." I went to the change booth, got two nickels for the dime,
and after putting one in the slot, went through the turnstile and walked into
the subway car in a daze.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be
wonderful to report that I passed on this great fortune to some poor soul later
on in life, but I don't remember doing so.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
daze lasted most of the ride home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
I finally trudged as quietly as I could up the stairs to the apartment, it was
about midnight.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I didn't have a key
and, oh, how I was plagued by what I had done.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I hesitated before knocking, tapped gently, then tried the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was unlocked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I opened it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the light
that leaked in from the hall I could make out my cot set up with the sheet
turned down invitingly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My chest felt
so tight I couldn't breathe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
undressed, crawled between the sheets and lay there with my eyes brimming and
my heart full.</p>

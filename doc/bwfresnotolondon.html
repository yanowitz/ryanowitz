following&nbsp;provides a bird&#8217;s-eye view (why do I think of Marlowe's
Faustus being flown&nbsp; above the world by Mephostophilis?) of my
life
between Fresno and Borehamwood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
another time I&#8217;ll probably flesh&nbsp;this out.</p>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p class="MsoNormal">During my first semester at Fresno, on December 28, 1965, I married
for the first time, to Sherrl, at a San Francisco home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
please her orthodox father, we had a
rabbi, and though he would have been happy to pay for a relatively
lavish wedding, as I remember it we arranged a quite&nbsp;modest affair. &nbsp;I
dittoed<a href="https://richardyanowitz.com/bwearlydays.html#bw_fresno_note1"> </a><a href="https://richardyanowitz.com/bwearlydays.html#bw_fresno_note1" name="bw_fresno_note1source">*</a>the invitation at the Fresno English deparment, and&nbsp;we asked that instead of giving us presents people&nbsp;make a donation
to Friends of SNCC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think a lot of
people did&#8212;though I doubt we had more than 40 guests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My parents flew from NJ for the event.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wrote a poem about penguins mating; Sherrl and I had this
childish thing going about being penguins.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>During the reception I gobbled many deviled eggs which I had managed to
have included with the inexpensive catering we arranged for.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I doubt I loved Sherrl, but&nbsp;I likely married her because I was
23 and it seemed a good thing to do to fit in and be ab adykt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Certainly I didn&#8217;t consciously say that to myself.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We I lived for two years at 1503 Oxford St.&nbsp;in Berkeley.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1966-67 I
attended the English graduate program at Berkeley, where I had always wanted to
go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a troubling academic year
which I&#8217;ll describe elsewhere, and dropped out in June (actually, I took a
leave of absence, which the department urged me to do to make it easier to
return, though I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be back).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whatever adjustment problems I had, I did pass the MA oral exam required
of all Ph.D. candidates, regardless of whether they already had an MA, although
my committee was dismayed that for a modern poet I chose A. E. Housman (which I
did because I felt I could master his relatively brief <i>oeuvre</i> in the
short time I had to prepare).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We stayed
in Berkeley another year while Sherrl completed her undergrad degree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In late summer or maybe fall, 1968, we decided to live in
Paris, where there seemed nearly to have been a revolution during May and June.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had a flat in the 9th
arrondissement, probably for six months, and then moved to London.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, we separated and I began a
relationship on which I still look back fondly, with Bretta.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She and I first lived in her flat in Vincent
Square (the same building, I was told, that housed Tom Stoppard, though I never
saw him) and then moved to a one-bedroom flat with shared bathroom in
Kilburn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p>In spring of 1969 I got a teaching job for a few months in a boys' state secondary
school in Tulse Hill, South London.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the whole, I don&#8217;t think I did well there.<span style=""> &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">While it is no fun to remember or recount the following
(and I feel myself breathing heavily as I type the words), I will do so
in service of relatively full disclosure: One time at Tulse Hill I got
so out of control with the class that I took a loose wooden desk top
and smashed it multiple times against the top of an empty desk, perhaps
splitting the loose piece. &nbsp;At another time, infuriated with the
repeated use by and my repeated correction of&nbsp;students of "different
to" (which I have since come to suspect is a legitimate usage in
British English, which only makes me feel more wretched when I remember
my inexcusable behavior) that I screamed at a student and maybe grabbed
him by the collar. &nbsp;I think on one occasion my department chair passed
my closed door and glanced in the small window to see me out of
control. &nbsp;He was a very nice guy, and had I been him I wouldn't have
wanted a me who behaved like that teaching in his school.</span><a href="bwfresnotolondon.html#bw_note1a"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">**</span></a><a name="bw_note1a_source"></a></p><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"></span>On
another hand, I had some limited successes at Tulse Hill in engaging
students (as opposed to myself). &nbsp;The democraphics of the all-boys'
school were relatively poor and working-class with a significant
proportion of immigrants from colonies and former colonies,
especially&nbsp;African and slave colonies. &nbsp;Among&nbsp;all races, criminal acts,
violence and disdain for school were common, and behavior problems were
the norm for all teachers (though while I knew colleagues who were at
their wits' end with some students, presumably&nbsp;they kept perspective
and did not fly into rages like me).&nbsp; A common solution for other
teachers, which I tried to avoid (my tendency toward rage did not
preclude&nbsp;pedagogical ideals), but probably succumbed to a couple of
times, was, knowing he'd leave the school premises for the rest of the
day, to kick out of class a kid who was so disruptive that no teaching
could go on. &nbsp;No doubt some kids exploited this pattern by "officially"
being thrown out of class rather than being truant.&nbsp; I think that one
of my techniques for trying to deal with such kids was to turn to them
and begin a&nbsp;conversation with, "I understand you need attention"; I
don't know whether this worked, but I would have been relying on the
kid in question wanting the other boys to be admiring his power rather
than watching the teacher define the terms of the fencing match.<p>I can remember a time when two normally good <a name="bw_fresno_note2source"></a>buddies<a href="https://richardyanowitz.com/bwearlydays.html#bw_fresno_note2">***</a>, huge
guys who dwarfed me but by whom I never felt personally threatened, got
into one of those arguments that will sometimes alienate young friends
for awhile. &nbsp;In their case, I knew that they were prone to violence,
and as they stood almost nose-to-nose, I put a hand gently on the
forearm of each, spoke in a gentle voice, and felt them relax.</p><p class="MsoNormal">I also had some kind of salary dispute at Tulse Hill, about which I remember nothing but which is revealed by <a href="bw%20letters%20re%20tulse%20hill%20salary.html">a few documents from that time</a>. &nbsp;The following extract&nbsp;from a letter I include <a href="bwfresnobckgr.html#bw_my_letter_on_fresno_ref">elsewhere in these pages</a> seems to summarize the situation. &nbsp;("The letter" referred to in the first line is the <a href="bwfresnobckgr.html#bw_fresno_ref">Fresno reference letter</a>.)&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 800px; height: 339px;" alt="" src="borehamwood%20jpegs%20compressed/bw%20%20my%20comment%20on%20fresno%20ref_Page_2%20extract%20re%20tulse%20hill.jpg"></p><p>While at Tulse Hill,&nbsp;I applied for jobs in further education, was
interviewed at Borehamwood, and was appointed as lecturer in English and Social
Studies.<span style="">&nbsp;</span></p><p>Having
acknowledged the mixture of troubles at Tulse Hill--a salary issues
that sounds as though it was no fault of my own plus teaching behavior
that was--and ready now to turn&nbsp;to the struggle I had at
Borehamwood from mid-fall 1969 to summer 1970, I can see that this
background may color readers' responses to what I narrate.
&nbsp;Whatever.
&nbsp;I would note that my memories of my behavior in Borehamwood
classes
never ended up with my being out of control--even though at times some
of my classes there (in proportion to the lower academic level and
expectations of a group of students) were themselves out of control and
I was at a lossabout how to manage them. &nbsp;In this case, though I
had
supportive help and advice from colleagues, and (perhaps because I was
dismayed by how I handled myself at Tulse Hill) I was willing to
welcome it. &nbsp;In the teaching job after Borehamwood, North London
College of Further Education (across the street from Holloway Prison),
I managed quite well; so perhaps I was working hard to learn.
&nbsp;Certainly none of the Borehamwood problems ever had to do with
class
discipline, and as you willl see if you follow the events on succeeding
web pages, my administration would have jumped at the opportunity to
use that against me.</p><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">PREVIOUS</span>: <big><a href="bwfresnobckgr.html">Background (Fresno State College)</a></big></span><br><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">NEXT</span>: <big><span style="font-style: italic;">to be determined</span></big><br></span><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><a name="bw_fresno_note1"></a><a href="https://richardyanowitz.com/bwearlydays.html#bw_fresno_note1source">*</a>Some readers may be unfamiliar with this <a href="http://www.everything2.net/index.pl?node_id=1043395">pre-xerox standard teaching device</a>,

more and more.<br><a name="bw_note1a"></a><a href="bwfresnotolondon.html#bw_note1a_source">**</a><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Rage has been an issue I have had to deal with throughout my adult life. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">I have struggled to understand where it comes from and to keep it under control</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">, and have slowly been successful over my adult decades. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">While a&nbsp;person at whom I became angry may
sometimes actually have behaved in a way that merits anger, there has

hate to say that it still happens, but very infrequently, and if
anything I have become remarkably good at staying calm and controlled
in most difficult situations.</span>
[Added July, 2012: I recently completed work with an anger management
specialist, and I'm much more at pease in my life in general. &nbsp;The
goal was&nbsp;not to eliminate occasions when I might grow angry
(probably an impossible task) but to give me tools to curb the anger
before it rises. &nbsp;I've been warned that an eruption might still
occur, but I'm optimistic that it won't. &nbsp;Much to my surprise, the
tools kick in in many other parts of my thoughts and feelings that have
nothing, at least directly, to do with anger.]<br><a name="bw_fresno_note2"></a><a href="https://richardyanowitz.com/bwearlydays.html#bw_fresno_note2source">**</a>I will note <span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">that
both boys were of Jamaican heritage. &nbsp;I emotionally resist such
identifications lest readers extrapolate a chauvinist agenda, but I
also realize that a non-judgmental awareness of people's heritage can
help a sociological or historical understanding--just as knowing their
size in this case, regardless of race, gives some context to a reader's
image of the situation. &nbsp;(How much I gnash my teeth when I hear someone
say "this big black guy..." in contexts where neither size nor race
is&nbsp;relevant for anything other than, by juxtaposing the words,
stereotyping.)</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> </span></td></tr></tbody></table><a href="https://richardyanowitz.com/bwearlydays.html#topofpage">Top of page</a><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Back to&nbsp;</span><a href="Otherautobiography.html">Other personal autobiography</a>&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">page</span><a style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;" href="theaterschools.html"><br></a><a href="index.html"><b>HOME PAGE</b></a></body></html>

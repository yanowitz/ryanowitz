<p style="font-style: italic;" class="MsoBodyText2">This morning we will pack our gear and head off to the
northern rainforests and the Sarapiqui River.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We&#8217;ll arrive early afternoon at La Selva Biological Station in time for
hiking and bird watching guided by one of La Selva&#8217;s excellent guides, often a
biologist or biology student studying the rainforest at this acclaimed
institute. Overnight at La Quinta de Sarapiqui, El Gavilon, or similar</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We drive all morning, stop for lunch, then go to a private
research station in the rain forest<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>near the Sarapiqui River.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
drive requires going all the way back to Guapiles and Guacimo, then instead of turning
south towards San Jose we travel northwestwards to the area of Puerta
Viejo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Early in the drive we stop at a
hotel so Josh can check it out for future reference&#8212;very annoying; another
consumption of our time for his benefit in the midst of tediously long bus
trips, and as it turns out taking time from our next activity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lunch café has a pseudo-buffet which we
are encouraged to use to save time, but it looks awful; all but E order meals,
which indeed were extremely slow in arriving.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I have Spaghetti Bolognese, the only thing on the menu that looks decent
to me.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We are consequently very late to the tour at La Selva and
have time only to go part of the way through the primary growth, although there
is secondary further on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The path is
narrow (width for one person) but paved sidewalk-like with few cracks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It rains constantly, not too heavily, with
the trees intercepting much of the rain, and I decide to get wet, using my
jacket to protect the camera and binoculars.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Early on we see a small herd of peccaries (and on our
return, after having left the forest, I see several that are relatively tame
and are grazing near human structures).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Trees that fall athwart the path are sawn just enough to leave room for
the path.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our guide, who seems very
knowledgable (she keeps saying a word that I take to be &#8220;abandon&#8221; but much
later realize is &#8220;abundant&#8221;), tells us that some people squat (as in live and
work) on forest land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(This particular
forest is a private reserve that attracts many researchers.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is illegal, and they may be thrown off
if found (later to return), but apparently the forest is sufficiently dense
that often they are not noticed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
some period (5 years? 10?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the guide and
Koky weren&#8217;t sure) they get legal rights to their squat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While there, they do illegal farming,
sometimes using swidden techniques . The guide says that their farmland loses
fertility after 20 years (that long, I wonder?) and then the squatter-owners
sell the land cheaply for cattle grazing.</p>





<p class="MsoNormal">Having been reading so much on swidden agriculture, and
looking now at this real and massive rain forest, it is especially hard to
imagine being able to destroy it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
secondary growth which we did not see is the result of land clearance gone to
seed; if left alone, the primary growth would take over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our guide says that some researchers project
the time as 120 years, others say longer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plants attach themselves high on the primary growth and send down long
(up to dozens of feet, it appears&#8212;I couldn't see high enough to make out some
of these plants) root tendrils into the soil.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We end this intriguing tour after 2 hours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Disappointing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had no trouble with this relatively short hike (1 mile,
perhaps).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Our new hotel is la Quinta.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mediocre dinner buffet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After,
we had a longish group meeting to discuss the next day and also who wanted to
go on ziplines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have some trouble
understanding Kody&#8217;s explanation of how they work, and although scared of the
idea, I consider signing up for it.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Maxine is asleep by 9:30.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I am very tired, can&#8217;t sleep, turn on light, do a puzzle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I finally sleep til 7am.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Troubling dreams&#8212;e.g., I&#8217;m in some city
(Highland Park?); our neighbors are white, boring, narrow; I meet some people
from another, slightly integrated, mainly black neighborhood; I think this is
much better.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am schmoozing with 3
other couples, and one woman gets seductive.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->Maxine and I realize this is a mate-swapping group and are upset.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><b>Feb 7, Tuesday</b></p>

<p style="font-style: italic;" class="MsoBodyText2">After breakfast we&#8217;ll finalize our preparations for our
river journey and shuttle to the Sarapiqui river to meet our river guides for
instruction. Conditions permitting, we&#8217;ll get in a whitewater segment followed
by a flatwater segment. Throughout its length the emerald green water of the
Sarapiqui river is bordered by verdant tropical rainforest, along with quiet
farmland.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most of the trees are heavily
laden with orchids and bromeliads.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
enchanting river lowland is home to parrots, toucans, oropendolas, sunbitterns,
kingfishers, cormorants and herons just to name a few. The Sarapiqui also
offers some wonderful swimming holes, quiet spots for lunch and an opportunity
to do some exploratory paddling on its tributaries and side creeks. We&#8217;ll pass
directly through La Selva Biological Station as well. Overnight at La Quinta de
Sarapiqui, El Gavilon or similar</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Wretched buffet breakfast.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We are off for whitewater rafting in two rafts on the Sarapiqui
river.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I carry almost nothing
(including no camera).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We get an
orientation spiel that scares me a lot (sequence of what to do if you fall out
of the boat and can or can&#8217;t grab onto it).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>E very effectively talks away some of my anxiety, and after the first
couple of rapids I become confident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">I didn&#8217;t know we were going to have to row, and when we do,
I keep thinking about galley slaves.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Following orientation instructions, I try to coordinate my rowing rhythm
with the person in front (Maxine and I are in the last, 3<sup>rd</sup> row, in
front of the guide, who steers), but I get irritated that others don&#8217;t seem to
pay attention to this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(G and a young
French couple row, too; G has done this before and seems to know what he&#8217;s
doing.)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I am now enjoying the rapids.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I get little fear-thrills from time to time, but it is a little
like an energetic bump-a-car ride, for we bounce off rocks or the shore without
danger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The difficulty level is
apparently about 2.5 much of the way, and when we get to lesser rapids I&#8217;m
impatient and disappointed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Maybe 3 miles along we stop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two guides distribute fresh pineapple and watermelon, nothing
else that I might want to eat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(It is a
shame that I am averse not just to these but many other fruits; a wide variety
of fresh fruits is available everywhere.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I do try and enjoy some of the juices.)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After this, the ride is mild.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Maxine and others go swimming.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Afterwards, people keep wanting me to say how wonderful I found the
trip; I say, &#8220;Glad I did it; it was much less scary than I thought, though a
lot of work at the end.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the
experience was not ecstatic, I did enjoy it yet felt the need to withhold
regardless.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Lunch is at 1:30--another mediocre café, where I have sweet
and sour chicken (with lots of pineapple); it comes with French fries.</p><p class="MsoNormal">We return to the hotel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While others go to the next-door serpentarium, Maxine and I stay in the
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I nap, read.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The buffet dinner is a bit different from
last night but worse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the room I
read, do a puzzle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I sleep fitfully for
30-60 minutes, get up, read, feel tense, take 5 mg ambien.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I sleep well through the night but dream
that Mom died (her operation to repair her tachycardia is Wednesday).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the dream I am disconsolate; other dream
features: stranger helps with my car; Jon Stewart is on TV but also next to the
TV as I watch; he is sliding a knife blade under the TV and it shows up on the
screen threatening someone he is interviewing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This seemed funny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At another
moment I am trying to find a guy who helped with something and return stuff to
him in a large cardboard box the size of a computer shipping box.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Feb 8, Wednesday</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>If conditions permit, we will run the Puerto Viejo river
this morning. The Puerto Viejo is a flat-water river that bisects a remote side
of La Selva Biological Preserve. This river rarely sees any other paddlers
besides ourselves and the rainforest is spectacular!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In many places, the canopy hangs out over both sides of the river
and meets in the middle, giving it an especially remote and enclosed feeling.
After lunch we&#8217;ll head over to La Fortuna for a dip in a spectacular hot
springs at the base of the Arenal Volcano. After a leisurely soak, we&#8217;ll
continue around Lake Arenal to Villa Decary lodge, a charming country inn with
spectacular views of Lake Arenal and the Volcano Arenal 14 miles in the
distance. Villa Decary is a former coffee farm located on a hill overlooking
scenic Lake Arenal and the beautiful Tilarán mountains. The spacious rooms have
their own balcony with scenic views overlooking the lake, rain forest and
mountains. The rooms are accented by colorful fabrics from Guatemala, pottery
lamps made by the Chorotega Indians, and fine wood doors and furnishings
crafted by local Costa Rican artisans. <o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>This is a special area of Costa Rica; uncrowded,
tranquil, and blessed with a uniquely temperate climate of cool nights and warm
days. The elevation of 1800 feet and abundant rainfall throughout the year
encourages nature: a lush and varied plant life, more than 250 species of
birds, beautifully colored butterflies and troupes of roaming and roaring
howler monkeys...a true middle elevation rain forest. Overnight Villa Decary.</i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I figure the dream about Mom means I&#8217;m worried about her
operation.</p>

<p class="stblpara">We return to the paddle rafts we used yesterday, but on the
Puerto Viejo river, which eventually merges with the Sarapiqui.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Puerto Viejo is calm and flat, and we
need to do minimal paddling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maxine and
I are the only ones who choose to use a raft.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Everyone else uses duckies (inflatable kayaks).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>E is alone in one, the others pair up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Arelene&#8217;s and M&#8217;s boat loses some air (one
of them, presumably A, fiddles with a valve that releases air).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>M transfers to our raft, but A persists on
her own, even though the boat slowly gets lower in the water.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We see very little wildlife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The river is bordered by trees beyond which are occasional
buildings or cattle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We frequently see
blue remnants a few feet square stuck in the trees: these are banana bunches
coverings that have blown loose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one
seems to worry about their effect on the landscape; in fact, few people seem to
come to this river.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""></span>The trip is over relatively quickly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bus meets us at the same spot
yesterday&#8217;s rafting ended and drives us to a nearby town.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Koky goes to buy some CDs he has ordered,
but they are not there.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Lunch is a mediocre salad bar at the hotel; the tomatoes are
pretty good (as they often are elsewhere in Costa Rica).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We drive 2 ½ hours and stop at a market/café in a small
village for a bathroom break, snacks or water if we want them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Out the back of the store and maybe 30 feet
below is a river; iguanas sun on the ground and the sides and branches of trees
between the store and the river.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
village has campaign signs, a bus stop, a few houses, a pre-school.</p><p class="MsoNormal">We pass by Arenal volcano (5400 feet at the summit), stop
and get out to look, take photos.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I expect to be bored after a few minutes, but in fact I find
it delightful (even though I can not figure out what this stop has to do with a
trip focusing on &#8220;ecology&#8221;; it is a totally human-made area, though I don&#8217;t
know how the water gets hot).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I follow
others in ducking behind a small waterfall (first I feel through the water flow
to sense what kind of opening is behind it&#8212;it&#8217;s ample), and I walk down about 5
levels over which the water flows.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
early stages are hard to maneuver (many rocks underwater), but I manage; the
water shoes we have brought help.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Maxine enjoys this, too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Dinner is at 5:30 in a local steak house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The restaurant has no walls, and we sit
beneath a veranda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The place is quite
clean and efficient, the food decent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After dinner, we have another 1 ½ hours along very bad dirt mountain
roads.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We stop on a narrow
roadway&#8212;maybe a bridge, more likely the top of a dam&#8212;to try to see lava from
Arenal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are 4600 feet high.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Briefly, we can see some steam from the
crater, but clouds descend over the cone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Some people looking with binoculars seem to see occasional lava
flows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am feeling jaded about hopping
out of the bus at every opportunity&#8212;it&#8217;s a lot of effort for little
payoff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think Maxine feels similarly,
but the rest of the group, especially A, get are very excited about each
possibility of glimpsing lava.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We stop
a few times; Maxine and I mostly stay on the bus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>




<p class="MsoNormal">During the drive Maxine and A talk extensively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A asks about managing money in a
relationship with unequal funds (particularly when the woman has more
money).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the conversation is
distracting (it&#8217;s hard not to listen), although I must use my headlamp, and
although the road is so bumpy that it is hard to concentrate, I finish my book
on the history of fire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is dark when
we arrive at the hotel, the nicest one<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>yet (or, as we shall see, of the entire trip), run by a male couple from
NYC, probably close to my age.<span style=""></span></p><p class="MsoNormal">I am asleep before 10.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><big><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span></big><span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-weight: bold;"></span><big><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span></big><big><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span></big><a style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-weight: bold;" href="https://richardyanowitz.com/arrival%20instructions.html"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: bold; color: black;">Go to:</span><br></a><a style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;" href="arrivalinstructions.html">Arrival instructions</a><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;" href="https://richardyanowitz.com/costa%20rica%20feb%206-8.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></a><a style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;" href="https://richardyanowitz.com/costa%20rica%20feb%2006-8.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></a><a style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;" href="costaricafeb03-5.html">Feb

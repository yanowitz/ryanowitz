is a broad topic with a rich heritage
of discussion. The more I think about its meaning, the more confused I
get. Is it the sum of existence "out there" at any given moment (and
not quite the same existence a moment later)? When are humans part of
it and when not? If the history of hominins has been an ever-expanding
imperative to re-configure&nbsp;their environment, should we define
that imperative itself as "natural"? Should we make a distinction
between our intended changes and the willy-nilly changes of other
living creatures (familiar examples: beaver dams, microbe effects
[thanks, Barbara])? Of non-living phenomena (e.g., volcanos, meteors
crashing into the earth)? </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">Does
the tendency of our conscious choices to have unintended consequences,
usually unpleasant, mean that we should view our own&nbsp;changes as no
less (or only marginally less) willy-nilly? &nbsp;<br><br>Do any of
those questions matter, or can we get by just fine with an
impressionistic meaning, as we get by with calling something "red" even
though we have no certainty that another person is seeing exactly what
we're seeing, and even though we're all responding to the same
wavelength of light? </span><br><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><br>As
I read the next text for the course, which looks at measurable ways to
plot human transitions from hunter-gathering (were we then more part of
nature?) to&nbsp;agriculture (less part of nature?) and beyond, I
suspect that some (many? all?) of my questions will be&nbsp;getting
addressed as the course proceeds--if I can be patient. <br><br>For
now, let me look at snippets of
Western concepts of &#8220;nature,&#8221; with which I have had some familiarity,
and with that context pose&nbsp;questions to clarify what confuses me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><!--[if !supportLists]--><!--[if !supportLists]--><!--[endif]--><!--[if !supportLists]--><!--[if !supportLists]--><!--[if !supportLists]--><!--[if !supportLists]-->













<ul><li><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style=""></span></span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">By accident, the jumping off point many decades ago in my own studies
for approaches to &#8220;nature&#8221; was the intellectual history of European-originated
attitudes towards language.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For example,
Greek and Roman mythology (at least) posits states of nature in which the
earliest humans were brutish and disorganized, brought to the &#8220;arts&#8221; (including
technology and agriculture) and thereby civilization by an antique master of language
(where language separates us from the beasts and teaches reason)&#8212;typically an
orator or philosopher or lawgiver, though&nbsp;in Horace (at least) a poet.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 14pt;"></span><i style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Genesis </span></i><span style="font-size: 14pt;">informs us that before the Fall,
humanity lived in a state of harmonious nature.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Afterwards, though exiled from Eden into a hostile state of nature where
they are intended to suffer hardships (pain of childbirth, food provided by the
sweat of one&#8217;s brow), Adam and Eve (presumably thanks to their gardening
experience in Eden) already have adaptations for tilling the soil.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Perhaps
not incidentally in relation to
classical myths about the power of language,&nbsp;reason and
law-giving, God has Adam confer divinely inspired names upon the
animals.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their sons become a crop farmer and shepherd
(cf. <i style="">Oklahoma</i>&#8217;s reconciliation
prescript that &#8220;The farmer and the cowman should be friends&#8221;); in murdering
Abel, Cain is responding to a supposed slight by God (one of those divine
mysteries we should not seek to understand), but I think their different types
of farming are symbolically crucial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i style="">Genesis </i>provides for a Western
interpretation of nature that says (for starters): (a) in its primal, divinely
ordained form nature was &#8220;tamed,&#8221; but (b) thanks to human frailty, nature
became hostile, (c) it is apparently human duty to re-tame nature (as part of
living a pious life?) as much as possible (although I suppose at some level
we&#8217;re also supposed to lie back and accept our divinely ordained suffering),
and (d) we should expect clashes between different kinds of farming.</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style=""><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;"></span></span></span></li><li><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style=""><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;"></span></span></span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Monasteries seem to have stressed self-sufficiency that included gardening (with multiple implications).&nbsp;</span></li><li><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style=""><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;"></span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Skipping over topics like the pastoral tradition, Francis Bacon's </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">advice

Original Sin drive opposition to what you, gentle reader, and I would consider a more
enlightened, &#8220;scientific&#8221; approach to the evils that
humanity has gifted to the environment, especially notorious today but having
roots in selection pressures in the course of hominin evolution?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think it&#8217;s no accident that scholars (mainly
in the West?) are searching for a meaningful, new term (cf. debate about &#8220;anthropocene&#8221;)
as we face the terrible, accelerating consequences of such a heritage in (take
your pick) recent decades, centuries or millennia; in part, this seems variously
to be a quest for a moral compass, repentance and atonement for not having
previously owned up to the (non-religious) experience of homocentrism, shock at
what our species has wrought, and maybe a cleansed, non-religious version of
the medieval geocentric universe that places us once again at a morally
ambiguous center of, if not the physical universe, at least our own species-wide narcissistic world.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></li></ul>



<p class="stblpara"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Back
to earth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My concern is to understand parallel
(and shifting) notions in other cultures, especially those most
removed from (or of minimal influence on or by) Western experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What other views (=definitions) of nature
were floating around, and how much gets lost, when translating, by using
English &#8220;nature&#8221; (or some other Indo-European language&#8217;s terminology, or <i style="">natura </i>during Latin&#8217;s heyday as a
proto-universal Western language)<i style="">.</i><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>



<p class="stblpara"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Does
this problem occur today when different languages address issues about &#8220;nature&#8221;?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While that would be important if true (I have
no idea about translation protocols for emotionally/politically volatile terms),
for my purposes, the question is&nbsp;about the past and whether scholars
today inadvertently blur important distinctions by falling back on an assumed
commonality of what is meant by &#8220;nature.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And vice-versa: does a Chinese dialect, say, translate English &#8220;nature&#8221; into a
term that misses some of our meaning (assuming we share a common meaning&#8230;)?<o:p>*&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>









<p class="stblpara"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Do we learn anything by reflecting on what
seem to have been (natural?) cultural imperatives to link agriculture (or anything
else relevant to human survival) to appeals to divinities, divination,
astrological influences, and the like? Probably easier to answer:&nbsp;does
human or animal sacrifice satisfy needs for truly (as opposed to superstitiously) protecting food supplies?<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class="stblpara"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p></o:p>NOTE
ON VARMINTS: Our recent readings included comments about how Chinese farmers
wanted to get rid of intrusive crop destroyers like elephants and tigers, and
one professor observed that this didn&#8217;t necessarily happen elsewhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If I understood correctly, the difference was
that ruling elites might, for personal purposes (as opposed to ecological
concern), protect such species (e.g., for hunting), so that there was a kind of class basis to what was allowed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I gather that such protection was flying in the
face of the (presumably) vast agricultural population, who&nbsp;I expect still
secretly destroyed these varmints when they thought they could get away with it. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="stblpara"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I wonder if, </span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">just as we respond with dismay to&nbsp;destruction </span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">(once to protect agricultural livelihoods, now for sheer profit) </span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">of what we see as exotic, appealing organisms like elephants or tigers</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">,&nbsp;foreigners who lack our&nbsp;varmints experience similar dismay&nbsp;at what we glibly destroy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p class="stblpara"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p></o:p>CODA:
I&#8217;m pretty pessimistic about the chances of rallying enough of humanity to put
the brakes on our freight train to oblivion, and I&#8217;m skeptical of the ability
of new technological fixes repairing the old without introducing newer, unanticipated
horrors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But neither am I repudiating
what I see as our biological-cultural evolutionary heritage that may end up destroying
that which sustains us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
habit seems
the result of some evolutionary logic encoded in&nbsp;genes from our
remote past for species survival (now,&nbsp;I like to think,
outdated**).&nbsp;<span style="">&nbsp;Can we postulate a different evolutionary path pf behavior for creatures with our brain capacity? &nbsp;</span>If
there&#8217;s any hope (about
which I&#8217;m also skeptical, but I have grandchildren and so must hope),
it requires
developing tools that the vast bulk of humanity will somehow accept for
facing up
to ugly truths about ourselves while fabricating and internalizing
behavioral norms to reverse our unpleasant heritage under control.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Perhaps this is my secular version of Original Sin mitigated by
ever-increasing mitzvahs.</span></p><br>*[Sept. 14] A specialist in such matters informs me: ",,,as far as Chinese and Japanese are
    concerned, they took an older term (with a range of meanings, some
    of them Buddhist) and made it the equivalent of English / French /
    German <i>natur(e)</i>. That was in the same historical moment that
    terms such as society, biology, and religion were imported into East
    Asia. The words today look venerably ancient (they are all derived
    from classical Chinese), but none is older than the 1860s."<br><br>**Hmmm.
&nbsp;I wonder if our epigenetic makeup happens to have evolved
a&nbsp;trigger to turn off survival impulses that are actually
self-destructive. &nbsp;Isn't it pretty to think so?<br><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br><a name="PRESHISTORIC_ART_EARLY_WRITING"></a><font size="+2"><span style="font-weight: bold;">PREHISTORIC ART, EARLY WRITING</span></font> (<span style="font-size: 14pt;">Sept. 19, with updates, in response to discussion-group remarks on Sept. 16 about (1)
prehistoric human artistic expression and (2) the first writing as used for accounting
purposes)<br></span><p style="font-weight: bold;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">(1) PREHISTORIC
HUMAN ARTISTIC EXPRESSION<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Intriguing
observations were made about how prehistoric humans (late prehistoric, but
still well before the Neolithic period) used decoration (e.g., body painting,
petroglyphs and cave painting) to alter their cultural environments or communicate
ideas (even if we can&#8217;t be sure exactly what those were).<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The
Peabody Museum&#8217;s Echoes of Egypt exhibition a couple of years back, for which I
was a docent, included a section on hieroglyphs that offered the speculation
that pre-literate Egyptian pottery designs may have provided a basis for a
hieroglyphic approach to writing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>John
Darnell wrote (</span><a href="http://echoesofegypt.peabody.yale.edu/hieroglyphs/ceramic-vessel-nautical-and-faunal-motifs"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt;">http://echoesofegypt.peabody.yale.edu/hieroglyphs/ceramic-vessel-nautical-and-faunal-motifs</span></b></a><span style="font-size: 14pt;">):<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Predynastic cultures in Upper Egypt created symbolic
representations of their understanding of the cosmos.&nbsp; On the surfaces of
their pottery they painted scenes, and along the rocky cliffs of the Western
and Eastern Deserts they carved hundreds of rock art depictions and
tableaux.&nbsp; These images are not literal depictions of daily life along the
Nile Valley&#8230;but religious, political, and cultural symbols. [C]ombinations of
images represent a graphic means of linking and reconciling the paired worlds
of desert and Nile.&nbsp; Over time, some individual images or groups of images
develop a specific meaning&#8230;. Although this syntax of images conveying concepts
is not true writing, as it conveys no phonetic information and is limited in
application, the recognition of the ability of groups of images to convey
information across time and space provides the protohistory of writing in
Egypt.</span><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>





<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p></o:p>Darnell&#8217;s
suggestion makes me wonder more about prehistoric art.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was there any genetic selection for human
expression through, say, drawing in particular or signs in general?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What have we inferred from sign language use
about development of non-spoken communication?<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Long
ago I read that cave paintings were magical efforts to gain control over the
hunted animals being portrayed, and until now I didn&#8217;t question that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But from where did that generalization
come?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Are there current cultures who
echo the cave painting ethos, and did anthropologists interview them about what
they were up to?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Even if so, can we
trust those answers?) Perhaps the paintings represented something entirely
different.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hand images on some cave
paintings could easily have been to preserve the&#8230;identity? inner self?
something else?...of the painter (or his [her?] family, friends, tribe?).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Might a painted scene portray an actual hunt
of such importance that it should be memorialized?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or a scene of everyday hunting that would give
viewers a reassuring reminder of the value of their daily lives?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or a teaching tool?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or some combination of such possibilities?<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In
a cave (say) with a plethora of paintings, was there any master plan for their
development?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Does what we see reflect a
sequence of pictures added according to some cultural standard (such as keeping
an &#8220;historical&#8221; record of important group events&#8212;and what could be more
important than maintaining individual group and existence through food
acquisition) as time passed?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why are the
scenes only about hunting&#8212;or are they?<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Why
were some paintings in dark areas where they could only be seen (and painted) after
some hiking, torches in hand (or some other fire-lit technology like torches
attached to walls and kept alight by designated members&#8212;an elite? a subservient
caste?&#8212;of the social group)?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was
the effect on those involved in producing (or visiting) the paintings?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Could
there even have been hallucinogenic
effects of the cave atmosphere in which the pictures were produced or
viewed? &nbsp;Were there health implications of inhaling the smoke?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">And
what about designs on, say, petroglyphs or early jewelry?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What specific meaning might they have had to
the carvers and their (presumably very small) societies?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is, might they have been more than just
decorations?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How might they have helped
cohesion in a given social group?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or
indulged what may be a long-standing human need to be differentiated from every
other human being even while having a drive to belong?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or helped distinguish a particular social group
from neighbors, who at least at times were presumably competitors for resources
(or, depending on how their cultures evolved, maybe even bragging rights)?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Darnell suggests about pre-writing
decorations on Egyptian pottery, were such designs already markers on the road
to what we comfortably (see below) label as writing?<o:p></o:p></span></p>





<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p></o:p>And
so on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ask these questions with the
assumption that they are impossible to answer with reasonable certainty, though
I don&#8217;t know all the tools archaeologists have used to diagnose what was
happening.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>







<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">(2) THOUGHTS
ON ORIGINS OF WRITING<br></span><br>All
that provides a segue to the evolution of writing and its relation to keeping
accounts.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Since
I knew almost nothing about Mesopotamian history, I trolled through the web
until I came upon a couple of essays by a UCLA cuneiform scholar, Robert
Englund </span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">(since these articles are available via Englund&#8217;s own web site, I take them to be in the
public domain)<span style=""></span></span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">: &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://richardyanowitz.com/englund2011a.pdf">Accounting in Proto-cuneiform</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://richardyanowitz.com/Late%20Uruk%20Pigs%20and%20Other%20Herded%20Animals%20englund1995g.pdf">Late Uruk Period Cattle and Dairy Products</a><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I also used (among many
sites on the subject)&nbsp;what appears to be <a href="http://archaeology.about.com/od/mesopotamiaarchaeology/fl/Clay-Tokens-The-Neolithic-Seeds-of-Mesopotamian-Writing.htm">an intellectually responsible
archaeological web site</a></span><a href="http://archaeology.about.com/od/mesopotamiaarchaeology/fl/Clay-Tokens-The-Neolithic-Seeds-of-Mesopotamian-Writing.htm"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt;"></span></b></a><span style="font-size: 14pt;">. <o:p></o:p></span></p>





<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p></o:p>While
this material is of course only a drop in the cuneiform knowledge bucket, it
has multiplied my understanding of cuneiform way beyond what I knew, and I now
have thoughts (more accurately, questions) about implications of what I&#8217;ve
read.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>



<p class="stblpara"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I&#8217;ll
start with this quote from Englund, which suggests that accounting functions <i style="">led </i>to writing (at least in Mesopotamia)
rather than actually <span style="font-style: italic;">being</span> early writing (though of course definitions are always
up for grabs, and the important issue would be to figure out what we gain by
making the definition one way or another): &#8220;Most who have studied the matter
have considered early writing to be a collateral development from the
exploitation of an increasingly complex method of fixing quantitative data.&#8221;<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
find this diagram in Englund&#8217;s essay quite helpful:</span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""></span><o:p></o:p><img style="width: 742px; height: 722px;" alt="cuneiform history chart" src="https://richardyanowitz.com/cuneiform%20chart.png"></p>





<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p></o:p>&#8220;Plain
tokens&#8221; are &#8220;accounting devices&#8221; with numerical meaning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have a range of shapes which probably
depicted certain market animals, containers and labor, and some have markings
that might have indicated quantities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They would have been cross-lingual and so could override translation
matters.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">What
most startles me about this is the 4-5 millenia (into what archaeologists call
the Uruk IV period) during which they were apparently used before a more
sophisticated system evolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(This
assumes, of course, that our failure to find earlier evidence of such an
alternative system truly means that such evidence NEVER existed.)<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Then,
maybe because of expanding market goods, around 3500 BCE and for two to four
centuries, &#8220;complex&#8221; tokens emerged; I&#8217;m a bit confused on the exact difference
distinction &#8220;complex tokens&#8221; and &#8220;bulla&#8221; (I expect our professor's account of a clay ball
with tiny cattle models inside is an example of such phenomena), but the latter
seems to have been a gradual evolution or adaptation of the former, and they
both seem important, contemporaneous responses to the growing limitation of simple
tokens.<span style=""> </span>On the surface of these balls (Englund
calls them &#8220;envelopes&#8221;), incised markings seem to have indicated what was
supposed to be inside.<span style=""> </span>These
objects
seem to have been (at least in part) developments to reduce the chances
of information being changed (or "reinterpreted") as time passed
between an agreement or planned
transaction and completion of the agreed-upon action.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">So
at this point a lot is being symbolically communicated without what we would
yet call writing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the earliest
cuneiform is referred to as &#8220;proto-cuneiform,&#8221; which seems to mean it doesn&#8217;t
count as &#8220;real&#8221; writing, yet smacks of &#8220;writing.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seems to be the stage of Mesopotamian
communication-through-signs that developed for accounting purposes.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Towards
the end of what is diagrammed above as the time of complex tokens and bulla, what some
would call the earliest (Mesopotamian) writing takes the form of transferring
the previous token efforts to incisions on clay tablets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(A case has been made that plain tokens continued
in use for another couple of millennia, maybe as late as the 7<sup>th</sup>
century BCE&#8212;a tribute to the apparent trustworthiness of their role among, at
least, traders.)<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">(Side
note: When learning about Egyptian history in recent years, I read accounts
that hieroglyphs and cuneiform appeared around the same time, with cuneiform
probably coming a bit earlier&#8212;around 3300 BCE.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The accounts of cuneiform I'm using in this commentary suggest a different chronology.)<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

it not be tempting (or "natural"?) to use the symbols for other purposes?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What about when an official&#8217;s role is

and memo-keeping might have gone on that has long since disappeared?
&nbsp;I'm thinking here of a far more advanced state of writing, during
ancient Egypt building projects in the Valley of the Kings, where we
have found huge repositories of discarded "notes," including satirical
cartoons, on chunks of discarded rock. &nbsp;Might proto-cuneiform scribes have idly indulged in (and shared) such activities during breaks or when otherwise bored and unobserved?<br></span></li></ul>

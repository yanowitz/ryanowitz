<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Near
the end of my sixteenth year, my mother's sputum showed blood and she went back
to Beth Israel for an extended stay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
woman was sent by the Jewish Social Service to take care of the children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was crabby and I was surly and after
awhile she didn't come back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hy and I
took care of things in a rather slovenly manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sylvia was at Craig Colony so that left us five.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Eldridge Street apartment was short on
rooms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One entered through the kitchen;
there was a short hall, a small room with my army cot and a bureau upon
which<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my ten gallon tank sat ; another
small hall with an army cot sticking into my room, where twelve-year-old Irving
slept; a bedroom for Millie and my mother, where Mom slept when she was home;
and the front room, with a bed for Hy and Abie.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;"><a name="meaculpa5_irving_death"></a>On
a good hooky playing morning, I awoke to find a stranger in my room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seems that Irving had been complaining of
a headache and Hy had run downstairs to the candystore to call a doctor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt embarrassed and a bit ashamed to be
in bed when something was obviously wrong.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The doctor glanced at me with disapproval and told Hy that Irving had to
go to the hospital; he would send the ambulance.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">They
took him to Gouverneur Hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had
T.B. meningitis and I didn't know what it was; and when I asked, I was given
evasive answers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I visited Irving,
he was in a crib-like bed, with bottles and tubes hanging about him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were no special visiting hours for
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stood over him, watching him
breathe; his eyes were closed and he was pale.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A large housefly buzzed about him and I attempted to brush it away
without disturbing him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It landed on
his dry, chapped lip and I brushed at it angrily but carefully.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I kept guard over my brother against a
fly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eventually I chased it out of the room
and went back to watching Irving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was
he breathing?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was that a death
rattle?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't tell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went out into the hall and found a nurse
and stumblingly asked her to come with me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She felt his pulse, pulled the sheet up over his head and disconnected
the various tubes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then unlike the
Florence Nightingales in the movies she left me standing there without a
word.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was November 14, 1935.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">When
I got home, I got a coconut custard pie and a bottle of milk from Dolinsky's
grocery store on credit, made my favorite concoction of milk, sugar and cocoa
and gorged myself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wasn't hungry, I
was empty.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
visited Mom that night and it was a pleasant visit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No psychic phenomena clouded her thoughts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She asked about the kids, of course, and I
told her the truth about almost everything.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She talked about coming home and so did I.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">After
the funeral, my Aunts Sadie and Helen visited Mom in the hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were cheerful generally, but
occasionally a face would twist.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Mom
said she had to go back to the sanatorium for a while, but she was sure that
this time she would be better.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
a little distressed by the atmosphere created by her sisters, but I was able to
persuade her that they were just worried about her.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">So
the kids that were left went back to the home, except for me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I joined Hy at the Lavenburg Corner House
and got a couple jobs that seemed perfect for me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got a job in a Billy Rose's Pet Shoppe on Fifth Avenue between
28th and 29th Street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I took care of
the tropical fish and the birds and dogs&#8211;I even helped attempt to get two Irish
setters to mate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I worked six and a
half days a week from 7:30 am to 6:30 pm for six dollars a week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was enraged when the boss took me across
the street to an ice cream parlor and treated me to a thirty-five cent
ice-cream soda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had never had one
before and I guess I should have been grateful, but I was angry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could find a better use for thirty-five
cents.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">There
was a girl who worked there who was about five years older than I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We went to 23rd Street Park once to eat our
lunch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She drank about a pint of port
wine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tasted it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did all the cleaning up in the place, and
I found that looking into fish tanks this way didn't give me any kicks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt like a flunky and began to resent
doing dirty work while this girl did nothing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I finally quit for no special reason.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">This
was a pretty great disappointment to my counselor at Lavenburg.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had told him what I was interested in and
he had tried to satisfy my interests, and I had failed him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He tried again. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>He got me a job in a dog and cat hospital on 94th Street and First
Avenue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could classify myself as a
Veterinarian's Assistant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The owner and
head was a man of about fifty-five, and his assistant was a recently graduated
veterinarian about twenty-two.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
got thirty dollars a month plus room and board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was on call twenty-four hours a day, and I slept in the
spacious attic in a tiny, uninsulated cubicle.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They provided me with a gas heater.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was in a quandary about using it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I'd have hated to walk in one morning and find myself asphyxiated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was cold in January and February!</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
job interested me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got the chance to
hold dogs and cats of all sizes helpless so that they wouldn't scratch or bite
the operating veterinarian.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Operations
weren't carried on because of illnesses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were performed in order to avoid the nuisances that animals in heat
can be to their kindly owners.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Females
went through a much more severe ordeal than males.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The operation for sterilization was called an oophorectomy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It involved the removal of the ovaries and
it was a major operation, done, hopefully, while the animal remained
unconscious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Depending upon the weight,
a specific number of nembutal capsules would be administered orally by me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then an ether cone would be held over the
nose, and the assistant (I) would attempt to make sure the patient would hover
in the zone of not waking and not dying.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sammy watched an operation once, but had to walk out to avoid fainting.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Sometimes
it wasn't easy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shallow breathing can become
no breathing quite quickly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When it
did, there would be a roar of frustration from the surgeon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would do several things to get the heart
beating again&#8211;pour ether into the incision, blow in the patient's mouth, slap
it on the chest, and finally pick it up and swing it around, and very often he
succeeded in bringing the animal back to life.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Those that died were apologized for and were disposed of, as the owner
wished, for a moderate fee&#8211;perhaps fifteen dollars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Animal lovers paid.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Disposition was in the garbage truck that came around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At least, the animal was shrouded in either
a rag or a bag, and the driver and helper would be remembered at the season to
be merry.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
males would stand, after having been doped to make them unresponsive to rough
treatment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their scrota would be tied
tightly so that the testes bulged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There would be two quick slices with the scalpel and the male seed
carriers would pop out, their umbilicals cut.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The incision sutured, the neuter was safely through its ordeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never enjoyed watching that,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I guess I empathized too much.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">In
the echoing din of the morning's squeals, yelps, snarls and yipings I would
clean out the soiled cages and mop them, and eventually the room, with a
carbolic compound that was both disinfectant and deodorant; feed the animals;
and take those that needed walking, walking.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The need was due to worming.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
would give the chosen ones their worming pills (amount determined by the
doctors) and watch them as they strained and evacuated roundworms.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Those
animals got back at me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For years, the
occasional nightmare would visit me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
would dream that I was evacuating, but not rectally; I would be vomiting
never-ending streams of wiggling, foaming ascarids.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd wake up gagging, not screaming.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Sometimes
I had to deal with vicious dogs, and I still shudder a bit at the fearsome
threat that can be conveyed by a serious of harsh snarls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also was fortunate to deal with many
wonderful, soft-hearted, soft-eyed, snugglers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sometimes I had to kill an animal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Owners who couldn't bear to watch their loved creatures suffer from
pain-wracking terminal illnesses would request euthanasia, and I would be the
administrator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It wasn't fun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would be as kind as possible, inject the
strychnine-loaded needle into the heart, and hold the animal as it quickly
expired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The disposition, always an
extra payment by the thoughtful master or mistress, was in the garbage truck.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
visited the kids at the HOA every once in a while and they seemed to be doing
all right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sylvia would write to my
mother occasionally, and outside of one difference of opinion, Hy and I got
along well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He wanted me to march in
the May Day Parade and I couldn't bring myself to do it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't know why exactly; I guess I wasn't
that politically inclined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
certainly not anti-communist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of my
favorite heroes of all times was Robeson, who may or may not have been, but his
sentiments were exceedingly clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hy
really got hot, but the hotter he got, the less impact he had on my
resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know it wasn't
spite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't march.</p>



<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*On
June 9, l936, I got a message at the Lavenberg Corner House to come to the
orphan asylum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was shown to a
hospital ward on the grounds, and <a name="meaculpa5_abie_death"></a>Abie lay in a crib with various tubes stuck
in various places in his arms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
didn't recognize me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seems he had
scraped his knee while running and playing, it had become infected, the
infection had entered the bone, and he had developed osteomyoletis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He died the next day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think I was there, but I don't
remember.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was buried in the same
Potter's Field in Queens where Irving was buried.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Aunt
Sadie couldn't keep her tears back when she visited Mom after the funeral.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mom wanted to know what was wrong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nobody could or would tell her and she
actually quivered in agitation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
aunts made hurried excuses and left.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Ich
darf zehn deh kinder," she wept.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Mom,"
I said, "they can't let kids come into a TB ward."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Eddahleh,"
she tore at my heart, "in the doorway."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Mom,
they won't do it," I cried.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Wait, wait, wait!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
about if I get the principal at the school to send a note about how they're
doing?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wouldn't that be okay?"</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
got in to see the principal and explained why I wanted what I needed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I explained my mother's illness, her extreme
worry, her weakness, and a ton of bricks fell on me when he refused.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Just
a note," I begged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He shook his
head.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
stalled Mom a few days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aunt Sadie came
again&#8211;again with the tears of compassion for my poor mother.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">When
she left, I was alone, and my mother was a clawing, begging, tearful,
whispering, promising, quivering wreck.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The words gushed from her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
became one gigantic, "Please!"</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Mom,
I'll tell you, but you gotta promise me; you gotta promise me&#8211;"</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
don't know what I said.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How could I ask
her to promise not to be affected?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet
that's what I wanted from her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
she&#8211;she would have promised anything.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She had to know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was killing
her not to know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I dropped the
bricks on her heart one at a time.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Irving
got sick in November.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He got very
sick."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Yeh?"</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Very,
very sick." I choked out.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"So
what happened?" her voice was rising.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Mom,
you promised!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I won't tell you."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">There
was no pause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Tell me!"</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"He
died, Mom."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Oy
Gottenyu!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Toit?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mein kind?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Far vuss, Gott?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Far vuss?"</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
was on a track now too.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Mom?"</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">She
could feel it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her moaning died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Mehr?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There's more?"</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="" lang="FR">"Abie."</span></p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="" lang="FR">"Vuss zugst du?"<a href="meaculpa5.html#dadmotherdeath"></a></span></p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Toit!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mom, please," I whispered as she was
suddenly silent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And then her voice
started to rise and a nurse was in the room and I was suddenly confronted with
people asking questions and I stared at accusing faces twisted in disgust at
the barbarian to whom they listened.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">They
injected her with sedatives but she died that night, June 17, 1936.<a name="dadmotherdeath"></a></p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
brother tried to console me, agreed that she was suffering tortures that were
being heaped upon her with no malice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the funeral he berated my Aunt Sadie for causing my mother's death by
her inability to control herself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Youth
forgets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when Hy, Sammy, and I
stopped off at Aunt Sadie's when I was driving us down to Florida for a summer
vacation, Danny ordered us out of the house because of the accusation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Children love their mothers, I guess.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">When
I came to the hospital in the morning, I was told I had to identify my mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was led down and down and down to a large
rectangular room, On one long side of which was a wall made up of what appeared
to be metal files.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a businesslike
manner a figure that remains shrouded in my memory led me to one of the files,
took it by the drawer pull and drew my mother out.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
looked at this familiar, yet strange creature dressed in a white cotton
hospital gown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her jaws were clenched
shut; her face was ashen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wanted to
kiss her, but I held back in embarrassment, or was it the fear of death?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was my mother!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should I kiss her?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Could I kiss her?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
kind of beast was I?</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
drawer was closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My decision was made
for me.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0.5in;" align="center"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">It
was a moist, mournful morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same
rituals that I was becoming too familiar with took place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ancient rending of the garments of the
bereft had evolved to a snip of an old tie or of the collar of a carefully
selected rag of a dress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The seedy
looking, black-bearded chanter of gibberish held out his imperative palm,
collecting from the small group who had come to see my mother into the
earth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were no eulogies
given.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I followed the lead of others
who threw a fistful of earth on the wooden coffin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was the end of the ceremony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We didn't stand around to watch the grave filled.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Only
Hy and I were there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sinki was at her
sanatorium and Minki had been sent to the HOA camp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we walked to where the cars were parked, Hy told me that Uncle
Joe wanted us to move in with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
was okay with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We got into the few
old Fords and Chevies and rode to the gates of the cemetery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A new Oldsmobile sedan blocked our caravan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A man got out of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knew him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I hadn't seen him for eight, nine years, but I knew him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I started toward him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't know what I intended doing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hy stopped me with a hand on my shoulder and
said softly, "Wait!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
walked over to our father.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
had yearned for a father all my life, but I didn't, couldn't want this
one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stared at him and rebelled at my
own feelings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite myself I was
attracted to him.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
remembered a conversation that had taken place before the funeral.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My Uncle Julius was holding forth in that
unique mixture of Allentownian drawl and Yiddish accent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It's happened before; it'll happen
again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The children go back to the
father."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd thought it too
ridiculous to discuss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For too many
years I had fed my hatred by totting up the things I blamed him for.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">And
then Hy came back to me and said we should go back to him! I was flabbergasted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Like hell&#8211;"I growled.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Hy
interrupted me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"I can't see any
other way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He's gonna take Sinki out of
Craig Colony and put her in a foster home until he can set up a home for us
all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He'll help us get along until we
can get to be a family again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You'll
finish high school and he'll help me get a job in fur."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">School
had been meaningless to me since the deaths of my kid brothers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd always been a hooky-player, but I'd been
smart enough to pass everything but French, and the teacher had made a deal
that he'd pass me if I didn't take the Regents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Who cared?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And&#8211;and with
Mom dead?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't<span style="">&nbsp; </span>care if I never went to school again, but
what Hy was saying shook me up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
didn't feel I could argue with him.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
said goodbye to the relatives.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
were shakings of heads, but no outright, "I told you so," though
there might just as well have been.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then we went to the Olds and my father perfunctorily introduced us to a
woman named Jean, asked Hy to sit in the back next to her, and had me sit in
the front.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After he had driven for a
few minutes, he took his right hand from the wheel and laid it on the back of
the seat behind my head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a few
moments he tried to caress my head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I angrily
brushed his hand away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He didn't try
again.</p>

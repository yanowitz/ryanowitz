  in a Connecticut town on the Long Island Sound a bit up the coast from New
  Haven.&nbsp; The town is 36 square miles with a population in 2006 a tad
  under 20,000, 91% of whom were white (as opposed to 68% county-wide and 71%
  state-wide) with 400 residents (plus or minus) who were black, Hispanic and
  Asian-Pacific.&nbsp; The poverty rate for the town was 1.3%, as opposed to
  9.5% for the county overall and 7.9% for the entire state.&nbsp; Walking
  around town, it is hard to notice any non-white pedestrians.&nbsp; You never
  encounter a panhandler, and if you did you would probably see a police
  officer seconds later.<o:p></o:p></span>
  <br><br>The town has its own sandy beach (the only one of
  significance for many miles, and which non-town residents pay a hefty fee to
  use), a charming shopping street maybe 100 yards long, a little light
  industry, an excellent bagel store, a book store famous far beyond the town
  limits, a two-screen art cinema, and numerous country-like back roads.&nbsp;
  The town sponsors a collection of modern sculptures, changing from time to
  time, focused on the town center and scattered over a mile.&nbsp; A large
  green just off the shopping area hosts concerts, antique fairs, a farmers&#8217;
  market (new this year) and frisbee players.&nbsp; A State park with beach
  anchors one end of town.&nbsp; US Route 1 runs through the town center, and Interstate
  95 has three exits for the town.&nbsp; Train tracks run near the center,
  though the only trains that stop are several local, rush hour-only trains
  (inbound mornings, outbound evenings) that link the town with the New Haven
  line to New York City; the commute to the City takes two-plus hours, and,
  judging by the weekday fullness of the station&#8217;s parking lot, many residents
  are willing to endure that time in order to live here.
  <br><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><br>The town includes a
  spacious gym, softball fields, tennis courts and nature parks.&nbsp; I
  arrived long after my son was grown, but I hear the schools are quite good,
  albeit often the focus of political wrangles.&nbsp; Parades take over the
  main streets on patriotic holidays, and July 4<sup>th</sup> has a fireworks
  show. The library is typical of upscale small towns, with a fair collection,
  a pleasant reading area, and always helpful staff who will go out of their
  way to find odd books on interlibrary loan for oddball readers like me.<o:p></o:p></span>
  <br><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><br>The political culture is
  middle-of-the-road conservative. &nbsp;Republicans usually have a majority of town offices, though </span></font><font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">in
the most recent election several weeks ago, a Democrat defeated a
multi-term First Selectman to give his party a 3-2 majority (and
therefore majorities on appointed committees) for at least the next two
years. The truth is </span></font><font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">that at each local election it's hard to tell the difference between the two party
  platforms.&nbsp; Symbolic of this is that when the parties
  have their annual softball game,&nbsp;players from one side may shift to the
  other to even out team numbers.&nbsp; <br><br>A Congregationalist church behind the
  green supports at least some progressive causes: it has had a banner in
  support of Darfur victims, and I attended a showing of an anti-Walmart video
  there.&nbsp; My wife and I also went to a dance there without being asked
  about our religious orientation.<o:p></o:p></span>
  <span style="font-size: 10pt;">While I wish my town were
  much more diverse, politically progressive, and included a good bakery and a
  supermarket with better culinary standards than the local Stop and Shop
  (a 2<sup>nd</sup> market, a bit better, is at the other end of town, but
  who wants to commute 10 minutes to pick up dessert?), I greatly enjoy living
  here.&nbsp; I arrived a few weeks after turning 60, the starting age as it
  turned out for town senior discounts and athletic programs, and although not
  an athlete have played softball, basketball and tennis with other senior
  guys, largely older than I, in generally congenial, supportive
  atmospheres.&nbsp; I have more male buddies now than anywhere else I&#8217;ve ever
  lived.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span>
  I expect I'll also always be viewed as a newcomer, no matter how long I live here.<br><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><br>The dark side of this
  movie-set New England town is the rancor that quickly develops when residents
  perceive threats to the life style (as they like to call it) with which they
  are familiar and content.&nbsp; Suddenly, neighbors who disagree are
  conniving agents of wickedness, and the &#8220;life style&#8221; <i>you</i> want to
  preserve is intrinsically the right one which only a knave or fool would
  resist.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll give three recent examples.<o:p></o:p></span>
  <br></font></p><p><font size="-1"><b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Town squabbles 1: development<u1:p></u1:p></span></b><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></font>
  </p><p><font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Several months ago, a
  private real estate development company went before the town zoning
  commission to request permission to build a shopping center at the
  easternmost I-95 exit, currently an undeveloped area.&nbsp; Personally, I was
  opposed to the plan for environmental reasons and a belief that we shouldn't
  be encouraging&nbsp;aesthetic blight just, as some supporters argued,
  to increase the tax base and maybe lower property taxes.&nbsp;&nbsp; I attended
  a zoning commission meeting to hear what people had to say, and especially to
  learn whether any support for the plan wasn&#8217;t about money.&nbsp; The meeting
  overflowed, and many townspeople, including myself, were crammed together
  standing up.&nbsp; The meeting went on for maybe 15 minutes.&nbsp; During a
  presentation by a lawyer for the development company, a booming voice
  interrupted from the entranceway to announce, &#8220;This meeting is
  over.&nbsp; Everyone clear the room.&#8221;&nbsp; Turned out this was the fire
  marshal.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t remember if his announcement noted up front that his
  order reflected a public danger because of the crowding, though this did
  become clear, but the military-like order and threatening tone inevitably
  raised many hackles, including my own before I understood what was happening,
  and prompted scattered attendees to shout out in protest and challenge
  whether the order was a result of town officials not wanting the meeting to
  proceed because it was clear the audience was overwhelmingly against the proposal.<o:p></o:p></span>
  <br><span class="stblparaMsoBodyText" style="font-size: 10pt;"><br>The meeting was
  re-scheduled at a former high-school auditorium that had enough seats, though
  not by much.&nbsp; After the real estate lawyer delivered his full talk,
  audience members were given a chance to speak.&nbsp; Many did, too often
  repeating what someone else said.&nbsp; Many speakers argued that the town
  life style (and environment) would be abysmally altered.&nbsp; There were
  claims that rather than help the town economically, the center would require
  more town costs in maintenance and police needs.&nbsp; A former cop contended
  that all sorts of undesirable types&nbsp; would be attracted to the center,
  some of them as workers, and crime would increase.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span><span class="stblparaMsoBodyText">
  </span><br class="stblparaMsoBodyText"><span class="stblparaMsoBodyText" style="font-size: 10pt;"><br>What I found as I listened
  was that I had little in common with speakers who opposed the center.&nbsp; I
  detected the odor of racism in the fear of who might work at and visit the
  development.&nbsp; Opposition to an added tax burden was clearly a general
  resistance to taxes for any purpose at all, including social do-gooding
  expenditures for which I would personally be willing to pay higher
  taxes.&nbsp; The only audience member who spoke for the proposal, and did so
  in a mild-mannered way, was hissed at.&nbsp; (Does our town life style
  include shouting down those who don&#8217;t agree with us, I wondered?)&nbsp; I did
  get up and a bit clumsily challenge the tone of those with whom I agreed.<o:p></o:p></span><span class="stblparaMsoBodyText">
  </span><br class="stblparaMsoBodyText"><span class="stblparaMsoBodyText" style="font-size: 10pt;"><br>There was no way, so far
  as I could see, that the zoning commission would have the temerity to fly in
  the face of the audience&#8217;s overwhelming opposition to the proposal (though I had
  no idea how representative we were of the town overall), and it didn&#8217;t.&nbsp;
  But I was more ashamed than happy after the meeting.&nbsp; Indeed, I realized
  that no matter how opposed I was to the proposal, its approval would not have been the
  Armageddon of town culture that so many angry voices trumpeted.<o:p></o:p></span><span class="stblparaMsoBodyText">
  </span><br></font></p><p><font size="-1"><b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Town squabbles 2: school bus depot<u1:p></u1:p></span></b><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></font>
  </p><p><font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A
couple of years ago, the town decided it needed an expanded school bus
terminal.&nbsp; Every potential site, including one behind the condo
community where I live, was protested by nearby residents.&nbsp;
(Readers may be familiar with the NIMBY&#8212;not in my back yard&#8212;concept,
which together with concerns about cost seem to dominate support and
opposition to local initiatives .)&nbsp; When the town finally narrowed
to the site that was ultimately used, local residents came to the next
town meeting with arguments blazing.&nbsp; (I imagine the spirit,
though&nbsp;not all the specifics, would have been the same from nearby
residents of whatever site was chosen.)&nbsp; Children would be
endangered by the proximity of US Route 1, noise would be intolerable,
other locations made more sense, property values would suffer&#8230;.&nbsp;
The tone behind the presentations was that the town council
(technically, Board of Selectmen, albeit women have served on it) and
the zoning commission and anyone else involved in the decision had
cynically and nefariously chosen this site.<o:p></o:p></span>
  <br></font></p><p><font size="-1"><b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Town squabbles 3: senior center, ambulance, library<u1:p></u1:p></span></b><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></font>
  </p><p><font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In the past year, the town prepared a
  funding referendum&nbsp;to revamp an existing senior center
  to serve as a small ambulance office while building a new senior center.&nbsp;
  The referendum was defeated.&nbsp; So far as I can tell, it was all about
  reluctance to spend town funds (and possibly raise taxes for the
  construction).&nbsp; Charges and counter-charges were made that an existing
  building could be converted to one of the structures.&nbsp; (I never could
  tell who was right on this last point, though it appeared that there were
  some valid reasons for NOT converting the building in question.)<o:p></o:p></span>&nbsp;</font></p><p><font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The
issue will probably come up again on another ballot.&nbsp; Linked with
it initially was a major library expansion.&nbsp; The town library was
last expanded about&nbsp;15 years ago, and current employees say they
have significant overcrowding.&nbsp; To an average occasional user, the
library can seem quite adequate, but I do have the feeling that
expansion would significantly improve library use and expand its
facilities.<o:p></o:p></span>
  &nbsp;<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Here
I think we run into an extra complication about spending money and
raising taxes.&nbsp; Many people, I gather, rarely or never use the library,
while all my life libraries have been sanctuaries to me.&nbsp; I think there
is some image that libraries are more for school kids at all levels,
and adults with grown kids may not see the point in serving the next
generation.&nbsp; There may also be some association of libraries and
excessive education (cf. eggheads like me) or even &#8220;liberal&#8221; politics.&nbsp;
(Why does it seem that the less educated a person, the higher the
likelihood he or she will&nbsp;fear&nbsp;change?)<o:p></o:p></span>
  <br><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><br>Those who run the library
  decided to withdraw the ballot proposal and await the November, 2008, ballot,
  presumably in the hope&nbsp;that large turnout for a presidential election
  will help passage.<o:p></o:p></span>
  <br><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><br>Aside
from my own selfish needs, I like to imagine that book education, whether
formal or personal, enhances society and the rationality with which
people think about issues public and private.&nbsp; At any rate, as Lady
Brett says at the end of <i>The
  Sun Also Rises,</i> &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it pretty to think so?&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span>
  <br></font></p><p><font size="-1"><b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cops, robbers, and dating transgressions<o:p></o:p></span></b></font>
  </p><p><font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In
  the last year, my town has managed to have three cops arrested, one (according
  to the local weekly paper) for wee-hours theft of food from a fish
  restaurant, one for using the police database system to vet potential girlfriends,
  and one for giving legal advice to the first.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think all of these cases are still pending, but the last
  one intrigues me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Supposedly this
  cop was a union rep and was&nbsp;advising his colleague to use his constitutional
  rights not to answer questions and to hire a lawyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why this would be illegal or the basis
  for discipline is beyond me unless the police code itself is constitutionally
  challenged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But you have to
  figure that more is going on here&#8212;that this last cop has a history of
  behavior that his superiors want to get him for but can&#8217;t make stick and, for
  legal or tactical reasons, won&#8217;t make public.<span style="">&nbsp;
  </span></span></font></p><p><font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Over the months since the first arrest, new charges have been brought against
  one or another of these cops.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According
  to the police department, it is already short-staffed, so the issues among these
  officers much be pretty grave, at least to the powers-that-be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One&nbsp;wonders if, for good
  reasons or bad, other cops will be brought up on charges as time passes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is certainly interesting to be an
  onlooker, sensing that more is going on behind the scenes than is made public
  but having little idea what that is.<span style="">&nbsp;
  </span>Of if the accusations are all legit, then it&#8217;s interesting that they're
  being handled in a way that unnecessarily makes the authorities look suspicious.<o:p></o:p></span>&nbsp;</font></p><p><font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">This
  is the kind of thing that makes citizens wary of trusting their officials&#8212;though
  admittedly for some citizens little excuse is needed.</span></font></p><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p><font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Added
January, 2008</span>: Since I wrote the above, three more arrests have been
made, two new cops plus one of the three previously arrested,&nbsp;for <a href="http://www.shorepublishing.com/re.aspx?re=0612a8ad-d1bf-420e-91c7-f95a68ccacab">consorting with New Haven prostitutes</a>
during the shift that starts at midnight. &nbsp;I have also heard from
someone who probably knows that the cop&nbsp;who seems to have been run
in for advising a colleague of his constitutional rights has indeed, in the
authorities' eyes,&nbsp;in fact done other things&nbsp; for which they
don't have enough to indict him. &nbsp;Who knows what is actually going
on, but such is the gossipy uncertainty that accompanies veiled
malfeasance.</span></font></p><p><font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Several days later</span>:
It strikes me that the cop busted for using the police computer to
check out dates was probably doing something a lot of cops everywhere do</span></font><font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8212;</span></font><font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">using
department information for personal purposes. &nbsp;My guess is that if
so, this is viewed within the culture as a to-be-winked-at
perk,&nbsp;behavior&nbsp;probably viewed by peers as akin to the pranks
of&nbsp; Sgt. Bilko, to chuckle indulgently at from a distance but to
be enforced with draconian rigor on the infrequent times it comes to
the attention of officialdom. &nbsp;Indeed, skiving off while on duty,
especially on the graveyard shift&nbsp; (though not necessarily with
sexual liaisons into the bargain), is probably not unusual in police
departments. &nbsp;How often have we heard sarcastic references to

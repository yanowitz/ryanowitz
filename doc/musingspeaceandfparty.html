of years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the manuscript is a
carbon copy on yellow copy paper with corrections often overtyped or covered
with x&#8217;s (those were the cave days before word processing), the OCR result had many mistakes.<span style="">&nbsp;

hyphen usage) or content (which I would now make more circumspect in key
places), much as I would love to have done so&#8212;though the text is not bad
considering that I apparently wrote it very quickly and with fervor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I note that I wrote this shortly before the rise of a new
feminist consciousness that would soon stop me from following the then-traditional
practice of making </span></i><i><span style="">male </span></i><i><span style="">all&nbsp;people of unspecified sex (e.g., &#8220;...give a reader the feeling he knows

<p class="stblpara"><i><span style="">As I
read and corrected the text, it felt as if &#8220;we&#8221;&nbsp;did not necessarily

sometimes hard to tell now where I stood&#8212;that my 25- or 26-year-old self would
have made such an effort towards "objectivity" on topics of so much importance to
me then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can see that the relatively
neutral reporting of the relationship between the PFP and the Black Panthers
must have been quite a volatile topic at the time.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

have left out events that are worth discussing; I tried to include the key
events of the campaign of which I&#8217;m aware.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I also included some paragraphs which are not critical to the history
(such as a description of some of the problems the bus ran into), but which, I
think, probably help to make the &#8220;history&#8221; less dull than it might be, and give
a reader the feeling he knows more than merely the well-publicized facts about
the party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have also tried to deal
with some of the complications we ran into in ideology, in order to avoid
giving this the nature of a party-line or personal-opinion history.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would hope we can start dealing with some
of the basic sources of disagreement in the party, and to a limited extent, I
tried to show how these came up during the campaign. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p class="stblpara"><span style="">This whole
thing, of course, in style and content, is limited by my having had one
afternoon in which to write it&#8230;&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: center;" class="stblpara"><span style=""></span>----------------------------<br></p><span style="">In the
early summer of 1967, the Community for New Politics in [choose one: Alameda
County; California] _______ decided to try to qualify a third party for the
ballot [in California].<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two
alternatives existed to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One was
to register voters as affiliated with the third party&#8212;the Peace and Freedom
Party was the name chosen&#8212;which would require a number of registrants equal to
1% of the people who voted at the last general election, or a little over
66,000 registrations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other
approach was to get 10% of the electorate simply to sign a petition expressing
the desire to see the PFP placed on the ballot. <o:p></o:p></span>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">The CNP
decided to try the second method. The reasoning was that it would not require
people to change their party, which many sympathizers might hesitate to do, and
in general, that it would be easier to raise the 10% than the 1%. Objections to
this idea were that the 10% was, in fact, more difficult, and that the idea of
an independent third party would be compromised by allowing people to remain
within the Democratic Party.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">Those in
favor of the petition method also felt that the black community wanted to work
for change within the Democratic Party, and in particular would be running a
black candidate against Jeffrey Cohelan for the Democratic nomination for
Congress in the 7th Congressional District.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, some people in.the CNP themselves approved of the idea of
working within the Democratic Party, arguing that a PFP.would be a pressure
device to get the Democrats to nominate a mass-acceptable peace candidate as an
alternative to LBJ <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">The
generally accepted third party ticket was Martian Luther King for President,
Benjamin Spock for vice-president.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petition campaign was tried during the summer, but met with little success.
When the Detroit ghetto uprisings broke out, many people were disillusioned
with Rev. King&#8217;s announcement approving the sending of national guardsmen and
federal paratroopers into the ghetto. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">The CNP
organizers of the campaign began thinking about a registration drive to replace
the petition approach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In September,
the National CNP convention was held in Chicago, and many California
representatives brought up the idea of forming an independent radical third
party that could function nation-wide.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">The idea
met with much opposition. There was general agreement that the CNP&#8217;s main task
should be community organizing, and many people were unconvinced that an
electoral campaign would be an effective organizing device.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Others simply believed in working in the Democratic
Party, some for ideological reasons, some because they themselves had worked
with the Democrats and had, or hoped to have, personal power within that party.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">The
convention decided to let each State make its own decision whether to try the
third party approach. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">During the
convention, one of many complications was the demand of the black delegates to
be given 50% of the vote, and for the convention to adopt without amendment or
restriction a series of resolutions passed a few weeks earlier at a black power
conference in Newark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some of these
resolutions were secret; one was especially controversial, condemning Israel
for imperialist aggression in the Middle East.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Chicago convention accepted these demands of the black caucus by a
4-1 vote, feeling unity with blacks was the all-important factor. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">The same
approach was tried by a black caucus a few weeks later at the California CNP
convention in San Luis Obispo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
time the effort failed, partly because many delegates were disturbed by the way
the Chicago convention had seemingly emasculated itself in an effort to insure
black participation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">Out of the
California CNP convention came the decision to launch a drive to collect the
66,000+ registrations needed to qualify the PFP for the ballot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8216;The registration deadline was January 2; no
one was sure sufficient interest could be generated so far before the general
election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But California was the first
state that would reach a deadline for ballot qualification, and people knew
there was strong enough sentiment in the State that a registration campaign
could very well accelerate and reach its goal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With California&#8217;s particularly strategic political force in the country,
people felt it was especially important that we should qualify a PFP for the
ballot if anyone else were going to do it in another state. The campaign was
approved. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">The drive
had its greatest focus In Los Angeles, San Francisco and Alameda County.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Offices were opened, leaflets and posters
printed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>People began to become deputy
voter registrars and to sit at tables on campuses and at supermarkets to
register primary voters . The issues on which we campaigned were limited:
immediate withdrawal from Vietnam and support for black liberation and
self-determination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This had the benefit
of leaving specific party policies and candidates open for the membership to
determine once we made the ballot, allowing a wide divergence of views among
potential registrants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other
hand, people frequently asked, &#8220;Well, what do you stand for?&#8221; or &#8220;Who is your
candidate?&#8221; and were dissatisfied at not having a lengthy list of concrete
positions and names.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">The PFP was
to be a separate entity from the CNP, although in Alameda County we functioned
as an independent committee of the County CNP, using their office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were not bound, however, by any of the
decisions made at the now infamous Chicago convention. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">The Alameda
County CNP did insist that we not actively register in the black
community.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We could welcome black
registration and participation where offered, but, the CNP argued, we would
only antagonize black &#8220;leaders&#8221; who continued to believe in working through the
Democrats, and who planned to challenge Cohelan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many of us were unhappy with this, feeling that part of our
approach should be to break completely with the existing two-party structure,
that if we agreed on trying to work within it, we ware sanctioning the system,
saying that major changes in basic American foreign and domestic policy could
come through the established system.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">Nevertheless,
we went along with the policy, partly because as an almost entirely white group
we were hesitant about our right to organize blacks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The registration drive began slowly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proposition P in San Francisco, demanding immediate withdrawal
from Vietnam, drew many of our potential workers until the November election
was over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By that time, SF had still
managed to collect 1000 registrations, although it was only afterwards, during
the two months left in the drive, that volunteers began to flock into the SF
office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>SF, on the other hand, had the
advantage that the County registrar (in a move he may later have regretted)
allowed the P&amp;F office to train its own deputy registrars, whereas in other
counties, we were required to schedule registrar classes in advance at<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the County Court House. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="stblpara"><span style="">In Los
Angeles, it was only about mid-November that the acceleration came which
eventually gave L.A over a third of the state-wide registrations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alameda County was probably the best
organized at the start because we had the functioning CNP to start from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides setting up tables on the Berkeley
campus and at supermarkets and special events, we fitted a car with sound
equipment and sent it through a several block area each evening, announcing
that leafleters and registrars ware going house-to-house in the neighborhood to
register people for the PFP. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">To our
surprise, we did well in places like San Diego and Orange County, though the
latter declined as the campaign went on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Marin and San Mateo Coun­ties began to build effective registration
drives, and Santa Clara County, of whom many people hadn&#8217;t even heard, turned
out to km be the fifth strongest registration area, after L.A., Alameda, SF and
San Diego.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">Many things
hampered us. We were told that registrars must remain neutral, and could not
ask people to register P&amp;F nor volunteer information about the PFP.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For awhile, the Alameda County registrar was
threatening not to train any more deputy registrars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(We got around that by pointing out that the Republicans and
Democrats were allowed 1000 registrars each in the county.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some radical groups withheld support,
waiting to see what our chances were for making the ballot, or arguing that the
best electoral method was to support Eugene McCarthy, who announced his candidacy
shortly after our registration drive began to accelerate. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">In early
December, our lawyers told us that nothing in State election law required
deputy registrars to remain neutral, so long as they registered a person as he
wished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was a major turning point
for us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had become obvious that many
people were registering Democratic, or declining to state any party, simply
because they were unaware of the existence of the PFP, or unclear about its
nature. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">We found
now that our rate of registrations increased tremendously as we were able to
walk up to someone and ask him if he wanted to register P&amp;F. O ften the
person had been meaning to, but had put it off, and might not have gotten to it
before the registration drive was over.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We were now able to inform people about the PFP and then register them.
We could also ask registrants to help on the campaign, which added many people
to our working force. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">The
McCarthy campaign required an important policy decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Few of us actually wanted to support him,
but we had to deal with potential registrants who wanted both to get P&amp;F on
the ballot and also vote for McCarthy in the Democratic primary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some of us were against any kind of implicit
approval of the McCarthy campaign, arguing that to give it would be little
different from those who actually wanted to support McCarthy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Part of our function was educational, it was
argued, and we should be educating people to what was wrong with McCarthy, not
giving the idea we accepted his campaign. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">More people
felt, however, that it was legitimate to tell people that while we would much
prefer they stayed with the PFP after registering, they were allowed under
State law to register P&amp;F now, and after we had qualified for the ballot,
which would be January 21, they could change their registration back to the
Democrats, since the deadline for the June primary was not until April.
Proponents of this tactic argued that we had no time for a major educational
campaign, though we could (and did) put out a leaflet documenting our
opposition to McCarthy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Registrars, at
any rate, were required by law to explain registration deadlines if asked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was also felt that we should not shut out
people who agreed with our specific policies on peace and freedom but were
unconvinced that ours was the best tactic for achieving our ends. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">Meanwhile,
we were developing registration and publicity devices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Alameda County we acquired an old school
bus and painted it orange (so that it became known as the &#8220;Orange Peril&#8221;) and
mounted a stage and sound equipment on the roof. An agit-prop group formed&#8212;the
Peace and Freedom Players&#8212; composed largely of people connected with the SF
Mime Troupe, who wrote and performed political satire skits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We sent the bus on a month&#8217;s tour of college
campuses around the state, with the Players, the Santana Blues Band (a rook
group) and two speakers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">The bus met
its troubles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the evening it left
Berkeley for its first stop on the tour, Fresno, the motor broke down before it
reached Tracy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In San Diego, the
Players were ordered off a college campus, but stayed when the several hundred
students watching demanded the Players stay and perform. In LA, a citizen&#8217;s
arrest was made when the Players mocked a high school ROTC exercise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In SF, where we had established with the
police chief&#8217;s office our right to use sound equipment, a sergeant stopped the
bus and warned he would arrest everyone on it if he heard us using the
loudspeaker again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He added that he
didn&#8217;t care what the police chief&#8217;s office had said about it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">Until the
end of the registration drive, we found a nearly-total news blackout of our
activities (whereas the Wallace campaign, for example, was getting good
coverage). Press releases and conferences were often ignored by most newspapers
and TV stations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About mid-December,
one of our publicity people wrote a press release accusing the news media of
deliberately ignoring us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether it
was that, or whether it was because the registration drive was in its last two
weeks, we suddenly found ourselves getting good press coverage. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">What was
thought to be a key breakthrough in the Bay Area also came in mid-December&#8212;our
alliance with the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The idea was first raised in SF, and because
a lot of controversy rose around it, a little background on the Panthers is
worthwhile. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">The Black
Panthers were begun by Bobby Seale and Huey Newton, both of whom had some
college education [degrees?].<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
checking relevant laws, they bought a second hand car and some guns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They began to patrol police cars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When a cop stopped a black man, Seale and
Newton would park their car, get out, and stand the regulation 12 feet from
where an arrest was being made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If they
saw the cop violating the law in any way, they would inform their black brother
of his Constitutional rights and warn the policeman he was violating, the law. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">To gain
publicity, the Panthers walked into the Sacramento legislature carrying guns;
they were arrested, and Bobby Seale received a 6 month sentence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Oakland, where Panther activity focused,
the police frequently tried to harass them, but the Panthers were able for the
most part to be sure they were staying within the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They made it clear to the cops that they
were prepared to defend themselves against police brutality, including using
guns. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">The
Panthers began to expand, many new recruits coming from people whom Seale and
Newton had helped in their patrols.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They adopted a program of necessary reforms in the black community, all
of which radicals, if not liberals, would find reasonable, including demands
for employment opportunities and improved housing conditions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many people might disagree with the
Panthers&#8217; tactics, but the reality was that they were meeting the cops on their
own grounds, increasing black militancy and decreasing police harassment in the
ghetto. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">Then Huey
Newton was accused of murdering a patrolman in a gun battle at three in the
morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Newton himself was injured, as
was another cop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Newton was driven by a
companion to Kaiser hospital, where he was arrested; his companion disappeared,
and the police were apparently unsuccessful in trying to find him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Because of this, Newton has also been
charged with kidnapping the unknown companion.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No except those directly involved with the incident knows exactly
what happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The press was quick to
convict Huey; the Oakland Tribune had a front page eulogy to the &#8220;martyred,&#8221;
dead cop.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">The
Panthers felt this was a political issue.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They argued that the odds were that Huey&#8212;assuming he shot the
policeman&#8212;acted in self-defense, since it was well-known the cops were out to
get him. In addition, the dead cop was known to be one of the more brutal on
the Oakland police force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Panthers
went further: they argued that whatever had happened, Huey should be freed
because, if nothing else, he was expressing the demand of black people to be
free, fighting on its own terms the racist society that had brutalized and
murdered his people for 350 years, and was still doing it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">The
Panthers needed and wanted support. They asked the PFP only to demand that Huey
be given a fair trial, asking us to bring pressure and publicity within the
white community.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The PFP had been given
$20,000 for expenses of the closing registration drive, such as paying people
to work for us instead of getting a job when they needed money (though our
&#8220;wages&#8221; were low) or providing baby sitting for our workers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We felt it would be a legitimate use of this
money to have the Panthers help us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
would normally have spent those last two weeks of December to raise money for
Huey, so we offered to pay them $1000, an estimate of what they would make on
their own, if they helped us organize and register in the black community.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">In Alameda
County, we held a meeting with about 100 or 150 registration workers and
debated whether to go through with the deal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Some people objected that we were &#8220;buying&#8221; the Panthers, or that we were
committing ourselves to Panther policies.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Most disagreed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We could not buy
the Panthers, it was argued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If they
were going to work for us, the money might be a factor, but it would also be
because the Panthers had a legitimate political reason for cooperating.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They, too, for example, were committed to
immediate withdrawal from Vietnam.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
were not asking them to embrace all we said, and we certainly did not need to
approve all their positions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were
making an alliance only on the issue that Huey Newton should be given a fair
trial.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">The
alliance was formed. As it turned out, we had many more registrations than any
of us realized, and we might have been able to make the ballot without the
alliance; no one can be sure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We gained
many registrations this way; we also lost people who had heard of the alliance
and were convinced we were now supporting armed ghetto revolution. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">During
December, we also tried some court tests of the election laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One law required only 1/15 of 1% of the vote
in an election to maintain a party on the ballot once it had qualified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We argued this was unequal application of
the law, and that to make the ballot should be no harder than to be dropped
from the ballot. We also brought into question the registration law, arguing it*&nbsp;should be January 21
rather than January 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This appeal was
baaed on two apparently conflicting sections of the election code. The State
Supreme Court denied both claims. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">Over the
Christmas holidays, we had our final registration push.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the last week of the campaign alone, we
may have registered nearly half our final total.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had the bus and sound trucks touring neighborhoods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had 1000 registrars throughout the state,
many of them working 40 hours and more per week, covering every special event,
walking the streets and stopping people, going house-to-house, setting up
tables in busy shopping and entertainment areas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had someone arrested in SF for blocking the sidewalk because
he had a registration table set up; as a result, the SF P&amp;F office
complained to the Justice Department, and the FBI began an investigation of the
SF police department under the provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that
makes it a felony to interfere with a registrar in the course of his duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F1081EFF345813778DDDA90B94D9415B878AF1D3">Sproul Hall mill-ins on the
Berkeley campus</a>** we collected close to a thousand signatures, stationing one
registrar at the selective service information window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Events were sponsored which allowed people
who registered P&amp;F, or brought a friend to register, to get in free.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The SF office held a series of all night
registration sessions at their office, and had rock bands playing throughout
the night. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">At
midnight, January 2, we estimated that we had collected 87,500 signatures;
three weeks later, the official count revealed our estimate to be almost 20,000
too low.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alameda County and SF each
collected 20,000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>LA had 37,000. San
Diego had 7100, Santaa Clara 4200, Marin 2900, San Mateo 2500, Contra Costa
2400, Orange County 1500, Sonoma 1200, Santa Cruz and Sacramento 1000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The overall total was 105,100. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">We soon
discovered that our troubles had just begun.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We were faced with the reality of having an official third party, when
two weeks ago few of us had believed we could make the ballot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had to begin constructing a concrete set
of policies, and to create a framework allowing maximum democratic control in
the party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The election laws, we were
discovering, were highly restrictive towards new parties&#8217; getting candidates on
the ballot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">We began to
make provisions to set up small area groups where all could come who wanted to
participate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We decided to let anyone
take part who was ineligible to vote because of age, citizenship, residency or
felony convictions, and who would register P&amp;P if he could.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lawyers prepared court tests of the
election laws affecting our running candidates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">In the
meantime, in Alameda County we held weekly meetings of people who had been
active during the registration drive, constituting ourselves as a temporary
decision-making body until we had processed all registrations and sent out a
county­wide mailing inviting people to area meetings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A temporary steering committee was elected for the County and for
the. State.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Several state-wide meetings
have been held, planning the State convention-in mid-March and making necessary
state-wide policy decisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Decisions
made by the interim committee would be reviewed by area chapters, and rejected
if the area groups wanted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most likely,
few interim decisions will cause controversy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The most controversial will probably be the decision to switch our
position from demanding a fair trial for Huey Newton to demanding his release.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">We have
only begun. Filing deadlines for various offices are scattered over the weeks
until the beginning of April.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The State
convention will choose nominees for President and Senator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Congressional, state and local offices will
be handled by the area groups in those electoral areas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Alameda County, our most promising
electoral contests are in the 7th congressional district, where Cohelan is now
Representative and where we have 13,000 registrations, and the 16th and 17th
State Assembly districts, currently represented by Don Mulford and John J.
Miller. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="stblpara"><span style="">We also
have many longer range goals, and one of our tasks is to decide whit they
should be. We must not merely look to this November*e election as our final
goal. But we have begun, and we have defied all political tradition&#8212;including <o:p></o:p></span></p>

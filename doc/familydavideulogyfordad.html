<p class="MsoNormal">When Grandpa Lou, Dad&#8217;s father died, I guess I was 9 or 10
at the time.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mom and Dad told me that
he had gone away and was never coming back. I understood exactly what they
meant, but it was said in a way that I could completely handle it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Though of course it was a shock.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It is remarkable to me that given how Dad felt about his
father - he didn&#8217;t go to Grandpa&#8217;s funeral; wouldn&#8217;t even if he could...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think Dad was in the hospital recovering
from a heart attack at the time - that he allowed me to have a relationship
with my grandfather.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was a gift to
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was such an important
relationship for me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Grandpa Lou doted
on me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Loved me unconditionally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And was very kind to me.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He was physically, very imposing to me, but
never took advantage of that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
gentle and patient with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a
blow to lose him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My father (and my aunt) had terrible experiences with my
grandfather, their father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How could my
father or my aunt allow me to have that relationship and not prejudice me at
all?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Remarkable.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">There was of course much more to Grandpa than met the
eye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father and Mimi have written
clearly about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And there was much
more to my father than met the eye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
many contradictions.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In November 1995 at age 77, my father wrote to me about my Grandpa
Lou and said, &#8220;In the past I&#8217;ve blamed my father for my behavior.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was an SOB to his family also.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He beat my mother and his kids and I figured
that that was the norm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lately I&#8217;ve
begun to think that perhaps his childhood had an impact on his behavior, and
perhaps he wasn't totally responsible for his misdeeds.&#8221;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">That was from a series of letters to me where my father was
acknowledging and apologizing for his own misdeeds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also in the same letter he wrote, &#8220;I&#8217;m aware of being a pretty
bad father and a terrible brother and a rotten husband, and perhaps most
regrettable, an awful son.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a later
paragraph he wrote, &#8220;There&#8217;s been a change in me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m kinder, gentler, and a hell of a lot more understanding than
I&#8217;ve ever been and I&#8217;m blessed by being more in love with my wife than
ever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never thought that at 77 a man
could be so happy holding a woman.&#8221;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">He was forgetting a lot by that time, but was still very
articulate in his own style, very familiar and comforting to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He wrote, &#8220;I&#8217;m keeping up with my dramatic
propensities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;ll be reciting Casey at
the Bat and a powerful piece by Howard Fast about the murders of the
Nazis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was Dad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Casey at the Bat on the one hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the Nazis on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was the way he wrote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would call him up and Mom would hand him
the phone and he would say, &#8220;Hi Davy-o,&#8221; and I would say, &#8220;Hi Daddy-o.&#8221;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">So, we made peace!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Not by avoiding and pretending.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But by facing it all.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It is a miracle that both he and I both worked at.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am so grateful that there was nothing left
unsaid between us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am deeply sad
about his death, but I am not tortured and distraught.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We expressed our disappointments and our appreciation for
one another.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I got to tell him what he
gave me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dad used to say to me growing
up, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you learn my good habits?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Why do you have to learn all my bad habits?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is part of my life today and his excitement, his wonder, his
passion, his values, and his silliness have infused themselves into my teaching
and my personal life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have fun with
my students while trying to help them be courageous, authentic and to
individuate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am so surprised to be so
very calm since his death last Friday.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A deep sense of calm...and emotional, of course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Freely crying at the most surprisingly
innocuous things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You probably know
exactly what I mean.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We went to synagogue together once that I can remember.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the High Holy Days when I was around 14
or 15, in New Brunswick.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I always felt
he was fiercely proud of being Jewish, but he seemed to be very uncomfortable
with religious practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got the
impression he felt it was mindless and even stupidly coercive.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In the last two years , he recited the Kaddish to me by
heart, I think because it was the one of the few things he could still do by
heart.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In the last year he told me he talked to God.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not that he had turned to Judaism, per
se.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can&#8217;t remember his exact words,
but he was telling me it was helpful to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It wasn&#8217;t heavy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
light!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just a simple, soothing fact for
him at the end of his life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
startled by his revelation. And very glad for him, that he found peace and some
equanimity in doing that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had always
seemed so tortured.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Because of my struggles with my Dad and his fierce pride in
being Jewish, I wanted to unlock Judaism&#8217;s secrets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I learned to find community in Judaism as I had in Alanon; to
reach out and be willing to ask questions, and ask for help, drawing on others&#8217;
experience and wisdom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result,
I&#8217;ve discovered a very down-to-earth practicality, a blueprint for living for
myself, and can draw on a small portion of its wisdom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of my father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And because of my father&#8217;s own struggles,
I&#8217;ve learned not to deal with life&#8217;s challenges alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he had been different, you might say I
wouldn&#8217;t have had to, but I probably wouldn&#8217;t have that huge gift in my
life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thank you, Dad.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It&#8217;s easy to hate a villain who&#8217;s a villain through and
through.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That's not what my father
was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was complex... as most<span style="">&nbsp; </span>of us are.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>That's taught me to think twice sometimes when I want to condemn someone
else.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I always talk about how he got his high school diploma and
then went to Glassboro State full-time, at age 38, to become a teacher.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He seemed to love it!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was an inspiration to me.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In the piece he wrote about Van Cortlandt park I hear his
familiar wonderment and wonderful love of nature!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How he found peace and joy!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Steviann and I were in Sedona, Arizona on Friday after I got the news.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And I took a hike by myself in that
wondrous place that I knew he would love, and I talked to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He&#8217;d been there and loved it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was glad that he was at peace.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And he taught me to find wonder and peace
and joy and comfort in nature, too.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I remember so well, him dipping his hands into the edge of a
lake to lift out a mucousy mess which turned out to be frog&#8217;s eggs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Look, frog&#8217;s eggs!&#8221; showing me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How could he touch them?!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How did he know all this?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or on the farm, he held a long snake, a king
snake I think, after he had washed it off, cleaning it up from it&#8217;s stay in the
chicken coops.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;This is a friend,&#8221; he
told me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They kill rats.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was scared of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, he wasn&#8217;t.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He knew.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How did he know?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Oh, he was reckless, too.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In so many ways.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Putting out the
fire underneath the car on the shoulder of the New Jersey Turnpike, in a blizzard,
with snow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Going out to the chicken
coops during a hurricane to hammer the roof supports back to vertical, so the
roof wouldn&#8217;t cave in.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We went fishing together a lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was a tough companion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Not always patient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he loved
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And he taught me to love it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was fun.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">He was passionate!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>About so much.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Politics.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being ethical.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If I understand correctly, after going bankrupt, he and Mom tried
to pay bills they didn&#8217;t have to pay to people who had extended credit to
us.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Like the milk man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I give to the Southern Poverty Law
Center.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I believe he was probably very
strongly supportive of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That&#8217;s who
he was, too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Politics with Mom and Dad
was not a game.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had practical
repercussions on real human beings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
they both taught me that.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">He was very warm when he could be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Always very emotional.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>About us kids.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About Mom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About Music.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ode to Joy, Scherezade, Paul Robeson, Oklahoma, Carousel, The
Moldau.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dramatization on record of
the McCarthy Hearings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And plays.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many plays that he did and didn&#8217;t do. THE
CRUCIBLE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>TIGER AT THE GATES, VIEW FROM
THE BRIDGE, SUNDAY COSTS FIVE PEOSOS.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We would sit, the three of us and watch someone like Maurice Evans doing
Shakespeare on Hallmark Hall of Fame on a Sunday afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was 7 or 8 or so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn&#8217;t understand very much, but I knew
from my parents that it was the Holy Grail.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I knew from my father...and my mother...that it was important.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Valuable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The first play I remember seeing with my parents was DEATH OF A
SALESMAN, in Atlantic City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s
ironic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A play that strikes a deep
chord with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And Ricky just got to
play Willy Loman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And I want to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I saw Fredric March in Philadelphia in
GIDEON.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was surrounded by the
arts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And that became my profession.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I learned to love people that are imperfect by learning to
love my father.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I remember the good, the bad and the ugly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I deny none of it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I&#8217;ve had to work very hard to deal with the effects of the
bad and the ugly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I, too, have learned to be, &#8220;kinder,
gentler, and a hell of a lot more understanding then I&#8217;ve ever been.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wish it had been different.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wish he had found more peace during his
life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father showed me what not to
do as well as giving me many gifts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Every time I make a certain kind of &#8220;Dad&#8221; joke, a silly riff, invent a
fantastical story to explain an ordinary event, say something that was (it&#8217;s
very odd to say &#8220;was&#8221;) so typically DAD,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I tell Steviann...that was my father.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You have my father to thank for that.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Goodbye Pop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I hope
God holds you in his arms and gives you peace at last.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><a href="familymothereulogyfordad.html#topofpage">Top of page</a><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="color: black;">Back to <a href="familydadsdeath.html">My father's death</a> page</span></span><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="color: black;">Back to </span><a href="family.html">My family &amp; its history</a>&nbsp;page</span><br><a href="index.html"><b>HOME PAGE</b></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"></span></body></html>

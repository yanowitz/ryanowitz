<p style="font-style: italic;" class="MsoBodyText2">Pick-up at Juan Santamaria airport, meet early arrivals
at Hotel Posada Canal Grande for a brief orientation and a light lunch before
we load our vehicle and begin our adventure! We&#8217;ll be heading overland through rugged
mountains, lush coffee plantations and small villages on our way to the
Caribbean lowlands where we&#8217;ll stay in the town of Cahuita. Upon arrival we&#8217;ll
have some free time to relax from our journey and explore the area. Depending
on conditions, we may embark on a short night hike looking for kinkajou and
other nocturnal animals such as red-eyed tree frogs or poison-arrow frogs.
Overnight at La Diosa in Cahuita.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Awoke 6:30 in Madison.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Walked to train station in strong rain (20 min.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>NYC clear.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Called Maxine on cell phone as I&#8217;m walking from the subway; struggled
with her about what food to buy for lunch.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">2pm: car to airport.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plane leaves 1 hour late.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
plane I have a foofooraw over the &#8220;beef or<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>chicken&#8221; question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How is each
prepared, I ask.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The attendant has no
idea and clearly thinks my question unreasonable.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In San Jose, car picks us up and gets us to the Posada Canal
Grande about 11:30.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Driver talks with us about what we&#8217;re doing and tells us
that a previous night he picked up G for our trip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>G is great guy, he repeats.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I have sinking feeling.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We&#8217;re tired and go to sleep by 11:30. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I sleep in some.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Maxine gives me sweet birthday card.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We meet Josh and a few others going on the trip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Air-conditioned Hyundai bus will be with us
most of trip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Seats too close together
(little leg room), but we will only be 8 + Koky (guide) + Josh (first few days)
+ driver (Ruben, accent on second syllable), and so we spread out one to each
bank of seats. </p>

<p style="text-align: left;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"></span>While there are some paved roads in Costa Rica, largely or
entirely on the coasts (but the coasts are not entirely paved), most roads are
dirt and uneven&#8212;sometimes so full of deep potholes that I wonder if it is
possible to traverse them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ruben drives
extremely well and slowly&#8212;probably under 10 mph a good deal of the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He swerves from side to side to avoid the
deepest holes, and I often fear is going to go over the edge (sometimes the
roadside banks steeply down) but I soon have confidence in his ability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Josh tells us that Costa Rica is 20 years
behind the rest of Central America in roads but 50 years ahead in education (or
is it the other way round?).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think,
of course, that is the better choice, and despite its stress on tourism I&#8217;m
impressed that the country is not fixing the roads just to suit tourists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later in the trip, when I see homes being
sold for ex-pats and know that it is a slow ride over the bad roads from the
nearest airport, I am bemused that so many Americans apparently don&#8217;t mind the
driving conditions (or the relative isolation of such homes).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Maxine and I sit in front pair of seats on driver&#8217;s side;
later she shifts to an empty bank of seats towards the rear of the bus; after
awhile I join her there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I face forward
so that it is not easy to converse; on the other hand, I may be happy to have
an excuse not to converse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much
conversation goes on among other passengers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One time I hear some liberal political discussion and someone enthusiastic
about Robert Kennedy, Jr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am turned
off. [My own politics are much more progressive than liberal.]</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><comment title="[if !supportEmptyParas]" xmlns="http://disruptive-innovations.com/zoo/nvu"></comment>After leaving Canal Grande with 5 of us, the bus drives to
another hotel where we pick up M and A (who will be rooming together throughout
the trip), then to airport to get E.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
have maybe 30 min. wait.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Using UBS card
I try to get cash from ATM but it doesn&#8217;t work; perhaps I have a different password
than Maxine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We will learn later that
most Costa Rican places charge a fee of a few percent if we use a charge card.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">At the airport, G engages driver in conversation in
Spanish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m impressed with G&#8217;s
apparent facility with the language.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Soon after leaving the airport, I see a large Intel factory,
maybe the only large industry I see the entire trip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this and other towns, houses frequently have fences, usually
metal, often iron bars, sometimes low and sometimes high, sometimes with thick
mesh (like fences at amateur baseball parks), sometimes with barred
windows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Josh tells me that
wrought-iron fencing has long been a cultural norm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Recalling the pre-trip warnings on watching our belongings, I
think that the taller fences and especially the barred windows bespeak a high
incidence of home burglary.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">On the plane I started a book on the history of fire, and I
continue it on the bus.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">While I am alone in front of bus, a vigorous discussion gets
going on <i>A Thousand Easy Pieces, </i>which in recent weeks has been shown to
be largely fabricated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Before we left,
there had been an Oprah program with the writer, whose book she had originally
hailed, and she lambasted his deception; she was clearly embarrassed and
outraged at having been fooled&#8212;in the bit I saw of this on TV news, she seemed
self-serving.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everyone seems critical
of the author, and the debate is in part over the genre that should be assigned
to the book.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I say that I think
the whole issue is empty and in this kind of thing (as opposed, say, to a
scholarly book affecting to set a historical or scientific record straight&#8212;though
there have been worthy hoaxes here, too), authors should do what they want (I
cite <i>A Modest Proposal</i>, though this really isn&#8217;t the best example).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This raises a furor, especially from S, whom
this issue apparently touches especially deeply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I make a few retorts to people, then tell S I&#8217;m sorry this upsets
her so much, then shut up about it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When I am sitting with Maxine on the bus, G, who is across
the aisle, makes pronouncements about the horror of child molestation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently just before we left there was
some newspaper article on a recent event (I may even have seen it), and G has a
particular fury about this, saying that such people should be violently
castrated (and, I think he added, that it should be done in public, and that he
would welcome the chance to do it himself).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After pausing to decide whether this is a point worth challenging, I
note that perhaps this reaction is extreme, and G mollifies his tone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is interesting how personal, highly
sensitive topics come up so quickly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The bus keeps stopping for animal or bird sightings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each time we bundle out of bus, are shown
what to look at, take photos, bundle back into bus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bus trip lasts many hours.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We drive from San Jose, a little south of the center of the country,
northwards and then eastwards to Guapiles and Guacimo (about 40 miles), then
continue eastwards to Limon (nearly 80 miles) on the Caribbean, then along the
Caribbean towards Panama to Cahuita (about 25 miles).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Several miles before we reach our hotel, La Diosa in Cahuita, we
pass a crude police blockade&#8212;a stop sign in the middle of the road with a way
station on the side of the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I
ask about this, I&#8217;m told it&#8217;s a checkpoint to catch Panamanians who may be
trying to sneak into Costa Rica because the economy is better.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The checkpoints are right at the border; on
the map this looks like the only road connecting to the bulk of the country.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">At La Diosa we are one of the lucky pairs with AC in our
room on a hot night (some rooms have fans).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pillows are mildewed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>King bed
with no night tables.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Toilet paper goes
in garbage.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We eat at Cha Cha Cha which others love; Josh tells us this
will be an especially good restaurant for the trip, so it is a place to spend
extra money (of our own, of course).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
orders bruschetta for everyone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>G, A
and E start what becomes a tradition of ordering a variety of dishes to share
with each other, and they urge tastes on the rest of us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Typically this will cost them a good chunk
of money over the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>course of the trip.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Sunday is presidential election day, and all alcohol holders
are sealed against use tonight and tomorrow night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For dessert I order chocolate cake with sauce.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I really want it all to myself (it&#8217;s the
only thing I&#8217;m doing today related to my birthday), but because everyone has
been sharing all through the meal, I share my dessert, too.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Oscar Arias is running on a Green Party ticket and is
supposed to be a shoo-in, though he might not get the 40% needed to avoid a
run-off.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Josh is a very slow eater.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We return to the hotel about 10.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I feel a bit trapped by having to wait for everyone to be ready to board
the bus back to the hotel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We will be
up at 5am.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It is probably today that the bus passes vast banana
plantations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bunches of bananas are
wrapped in blue bags against pests.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Josh says the plantations use vast amounts of pesticides which have
gotten into the water and been carried to the sea, destroying coral reefs; he
urges us to eat only organic bananas when we return home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is an area, he argues, in which
consumers have power.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We also pass herds of cattle, many of which are Brahmins (I
ask when and from where they were imported).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Josh tells us that Costa Rica has a 2-tier beef system: the better beef
is exported, the lesser is left for local people.</p>





<p class="MsoNormal">Josh also explains that the government has set aside 25% of
the land to remain undeveloped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Seeing
the banana plantations, however (and at other times we will see other kinds of
plantation: pineapple, palm for palm oil, coffee), and hearing Josh&#8217;s tale
about pesticide run-off, it is clear that major landholders retain considerable
power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One such holder is Dole.<comment title="[if !supportEmptyParas]" xmlns="http://disruptive-innovations.com/zoo/nvu"></comment></p><p class="MsoNormal"><comment title="[if !supportEmptyParas]" xmlns="http://disruptive-innovations.com/zoo/nvu"></comment><b>Feb 5, Sunday<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p style="font-style: italic;" class="MsoBodyText2">We&#8217;ll be up before dawn and head over to Aviarios Sloth
Reserve, a privately owned and operated wildlife sanctuary which provides a
protected habitat for the wide range of flora and fauna characteristic of the
humid tropical forest, tropical river delta and marshland ecosystems. The
spacious veranda of Aviarios overlooks part of a magnificent system of natural
freshwater canals and lagoons which form the delta of the Estrella River. We&#8217;ll
start our morning with a few hours of canoeing and dawn birding on the river
Estrella. This is a rare rainforest wetlands habitat and bird life is
astounding. In this lovely protected setting, we have observed 314 (and still
counting) species of birds including aquatic, arboreal, migratory, marine birds
and birds of prey. Monkeys, sloths, river otter, caiman, river turtles as well
as many other minor species are part of these ecosystems. Wondrous blue Morpho
Peleides butterflies abound. We&#8217;ll come back from our canoeing in time for a
late breakfast at Aviarios and a tour of their scientific research facilities.
Aviarios is one of the only places in the world you can experience sloths
intimately in their natural habitat. There are several resident sloths,
including friendly &#8220;Buttercup&#8221; featured in our brochure.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;" class="MsoBodyText2">This afternoon we&#8217;ll hike the rainforest trails of
Cahuita National Park in search of white-faced capuchin monkeys, dancing blue
morpho butterflies, exotic tropical birds and other exotic wildlife. This is
one of the best places to see monkeys on the trip. We&#8217;ll cool off with a
delightful dip in the warm ocean waters before heading into town. Evening
dinner in the multi-cultural town of Cahuita with its steamy afro-Caribbean
flair. Overnight at La Diosa</p>

<p class="stblpara">I felt as though I couldn't sleep for hrs and wake at 5:10
exhausted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Koky wakes us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bus takes us to a canoeing/sloth
site.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="stblpara">The canoe trip is supposed to be 1 hour but it seems to keep
going on and on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(How much of this
travel was driven by Josh?)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am asked
if I would mind paddling from the front of one of the 2 canoes; a guide paddles
in the rear of each.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our canoe includes
Koky, M, Maxine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I become irritated
about the amount of work I have to do.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>M offers to paddle (from middle of boat); at first I say no, later I let
her and am relieved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can&#8217;t take
picture.</p>

<p class="stblpara">Finally back at the canoe lodge (which used to have overnight
accommodations), we have breakfast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
married couple who owns the lodge (he is Costa Rican, she is American, from
Alaska) show us around and lecture about sloths.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="stblpara">The couple protects and rescues hurt or abandoned
sloths.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have some cages that
contain sloths, a large lecture room with DVD facilities and skeletons of the
two types of sloth (2-toed and 3-toed).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Four caged, orphaned sloths are touching to see, and there are a number
of baby sloths.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When nursed sloths are
healthy, the couple may release them back into the wild (I thought I heard
contradictory statements on this); remembering non-interference with wildlife
in the Galapagos, I first thought this was a mistake; later in the trip I
realized that a key difference in the two cases is the presence or non-presence
of a resident human population.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
couple has invented much of what they do,</p>

<p class="stblpara">I ask about the clash between Costa Rica&#8217;s image of
environmentalism and democracy on the one hand, the power of corporations on
the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defensive immediate
reaction: &#8220;What about US actions in Alaska?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(I think of when I visited in Moscow in 1965 and questioned people about
press censorship, and they responded that American newspapers, including the NY
Times, have their own way of censoring/slanting news.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then there was the time 35 years ago or so when I said to my
French cousin, Jai, an agricultural adviser for the French government, that I
hoped he was advising farmers not to make the same polluting mistakes the US
had, and he answered, &#8220;When we&#8217;re as well off as the US, we&#8217;ll worry about
that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The difference, though, is
accusing the questioner of being no better vs. not caring about/believing in
problems that stand in your way.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
tried to explain gently that I made no defense at all for US actions but wanted
to understand what is happening in Costa Rica.</p>

<p class="stblpara">When we are ready to leave, we wait a long time&#8212;maybe half an
hour&#8212;for Josh who, it turns out, is showing M around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maxine thinks he is currying M&#8217;s favor for press publicity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also gives us a sad apology about a
kinkajou that had been hurt and eventually died (?) that he wanted to
visit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am very annoyed with Josh and
his self-serving story, and Maxine is not sympathetic, either.</p>

<p class="stblpara">We return to the hotel for an hour, shower, and leave for an
afternoon hike of 6 km; it seems much longer, and I am shortly exhausted from
the heat and humidity and carrying a backpack.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I walk slowly, shoulders aching.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My lungs and legs are fine, but I plod on step by step with little
enjoyment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I make many sardonic
comments about myself, and others express appreciation that I don&#8217;t make the
hike miserable for them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We see howler
monkeys, capuchins, one sloth high in a tree (G spots its shit although he did
not join us at the sloth reserve).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="stblpara">A mile from the end we stop on a beach and swim in the very
shallow Caribbean.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wade into the
water with little hesitation and find the wading/immersion immensely
relaxing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>G helps carry some of my
stuff across a small watery area until we reach the beach.</p>

<p class="stblpara">When we continue the hike, Josh carries all my gear the rest
of the way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is now evening (I am
concerned about getting bitten by bugs but I don&#8217;t) and gets dark while we walk
(for no good reason I had packed my headlamp before the hike and use it for
some of the remainder of the walk), but for whichever reasons, I feel revived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the bus, I flop gratefully into my
seat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It feels glorious to know I don&#8217;t
have to hike any more.</p>

<p class="stblpara">We eat again at Cha Cha.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I eat much more modestly (filet mignon with mushrooms), no dessert.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I ask about the steak, the waitress
praises it as &#8220;for export&#8221;; I repress my knowledge that this means it is better
beef than what native Costa Ricans get.</p>I get to sleep ok.<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"></span></td></tr></tbody></table><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: bold; color: black;">Go to:</span><br><a style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;" href="arrivalinstructions.html">Arrival instructions</a><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;" href="https://richardyanowitz.com/costa%20rica%20feb%206-8.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></a><a style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;" href="https://richardyanowitz.com/costa%20rica%20feb%2006-8.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Feb

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
used to run the sixteen millimeter movie projector.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The projector in Harry Goldschlagg's camp went off the blink and
we loaned them ours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was sent along
to operate the precious equipment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
had a long talk with Harry while I was there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was applying for entrance to Iowa State, was sure of acceptance, and
assured me that I would be accepted if I applied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He convinced me and I sent for the application form, filled it
out, sent it off, and arranged to be discharged from the CCC in order to go to
college.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
application form arrived and was returned and nothing happened for a
while.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then my discharge came through;
I lost hope and took the long train trip home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I thought it might be fun to stop off in Chicago for a couple of hours
and ran into another member of the tribe of ubiquitous homosexuals when I
innocently asked a middle-aged gentleman for directions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My disgust transferred itself to the whole
city of Chicago and I hopped back on the train to New York City.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
met Harry about eight years later in New York.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He'd graduated from Iowa State.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Where were you?" he asked.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"I kept waiting for you to come.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Your name was on the list."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0.5in;" align="center">*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I'd
accumulated some money in the C's and Hy and I took a room on 137th Street and
the West Side near City College.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
started going out with a rather attractive young lady who lived in The
Bronx.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think her name was Esther.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had gotten a part in another Madison
Square Garden Communist Party extravaganza, The Lenin Memorial Pageant, and had
given her a ticket.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Meanwhile
a girl friend of Hy's named Fay introduced us to a couple of girls who were
going to CCNY at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had taken
a couple of rooms a few houses down from us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their names were Mae and Ida.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
turned out that Mae was working at the Army Finance Department which,
coincidentally, disbursed final CCC payments to honorably discharged
veterans.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She actually processed my
discharge papers and hurried my final check along.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was grateful and asked her out when I wasn't dating
Esther.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hy was the one who gave her a
pass to the pageant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That has
occasionally been thrown up to me.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Though
I didn't realize it, I was at the prime age for being hog-tied and Esther
invited me up to her home for dinner with her parents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the interrogation was over, I said my
goodbyes and Esther followed me out to the hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we embraced on the marble steps leading downstairs, I came eyeball
to eyeball with a rather large louse that munched on her scalp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My ballooning<span style="">&nbsp; </span>passions deflating, I bade her goodbye, and leaving, itched all
the way home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I made no attempt to see
her again.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"O

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Jobs
were still not easy to get, but I finally landed one as a gofer at The
Streamline Button Company in the garment district.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My first day of work I had no problems and the boss seemed
satisfied. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>My second day I was sent to
deliver an order of buttons to a place that was being picketed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a short consultation with myself and
refused to cross the picket line.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
astonished my boss and I was summarily fired.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Mae
insisted on preparing some meals for me and eventually I met her family, the
Merrells (condensed from Mutterperl): her father, David; her mother, Bertha;
and her two sisters, Silvia and Virginia.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mae's father had a retail coat and suit store and got one of his
wholesalers to give me a job as a shipping clerk for sixteen dollars a
week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I introduced Mae to my
father, he accused me of robbing the cradle&#8211;she was a skinny little thing and
looked about fourteen, I guess, but what a brain!</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
practiced<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a non-sexist regimen even
then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mae paid the two dollar license
fee, the seven dollars for the pearl engagement ring and a like amount for the
wedding ring.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We made an arrangement to
meet at Canal Street and Broadway to buy the rings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, communication between us failed (a chronic fault)and I
waited and waited and waited, and would probably still be waiting if I didn't
finally bethink myself that there might be another subway entrance besides the
one I was waiting at.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was. . .and
so we were married.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
were married on Sunday, March 2nd, 1941, at Mae's parents' home in Mount
Vernon, N.Y.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hy was my best man, my
Aunt Mae stood in for my father who didn't come for some reason or other (I
wasn't unhappy about it), and I crunched the light bulb that was substituted
for the traditional glass and so we were wed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We had a wedding breakfast and once I learned that hitting a spoon
against a glass was the signal for me to kiss my blue-lace bodiced bride, I
rattled merrily away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the
breakfast, Hy entertained the assemblage with an oral piece he'd developed from
<i>Johnny Got His Gun</i> by Dalton Trumbo.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was a strong pacifist indictment of war and upset Mae's Uncle Marcy,
who wanted the U.S. to get into the war against Hitler.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He made a speech and Hy countered and it
looked like havoc until Mae stepped in and requested firmly that such
discussions be terminated as of "NOW!", was applauded, and the
festivities meandered on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What a
woman!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What a woman!</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Mae's
sister, Silvia suggested we save money by using a friend of hers who was an
amateur photographer for the wedding pictures.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The temptation to save money was too great to resist and we agreed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He flashed pictures throughout the ceremony
and we posed with dreams in our hearts.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">In
the car driving down to our honeymoon-and-after apartment, which was on the
fourth floor of 368 East Tenth between Avenues C and D, Mae told me that the
son-of-a-bitch had made a pass at her, demanded a kiss, and left in a huff when
he met with adamant refusal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We never
did get any wedding pictures.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
carried some of our belongings upstairs and we went down to get some more and
found a parking ticket under the windshield wiper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I found a parking place across the street while Mae went back
upstairs with another heavy load.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
finally arrived upstairs with the car-emptying bundles and when I got to the
fourth floor apartment I found the door locked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I swore a bloody oath, unlocked the door, called,
"Mae," got no answer and started to get a creepy feeling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Mae," I called again and then
scouted the apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She wasn't
there!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked out the window; she
wasn't down on the sidewalk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ran up
to the roof; no Mae.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ran all the way
downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stood in front of the
building and I shouted, "Mae!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mae!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mae!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was going mad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
bubonic plague story about the mother and daughter in a hotel in Paris started
to haunt me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went mad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I shouted up the building from the ground
floor, "Mae! Mae! Mae!" went outside and shouted up to the fourth
floor again and, distraught, I stared at the building next door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a twin of ours.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Well,
it's about time," my bride said as I staggered onto the fourth floor
landing where she sat placidly on her suitcase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"My key doesn't work."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With my saber I cut her head off&#8211;nono, I clasped her to me feverishly,
passionately, lovingly, and she was nonplussed until I picked up her suitcase,
carried it downstairs and led her into the correct building where she
apologized feverishly, passionately and lovingly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>God, how tolerant and forgiving I was then!</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Hy
moved in with us and Mae was hard put to hold to her projected weekly
budget.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hy, kainenhorra, could
eat!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was broke and he borrowed and
who could deny him?</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">A
world-shaking event occurred on June 17, 1941.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was a Sunday and we enjoyed sleeping late when we could.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were catapulted from our bed by a
Gestapo-like drumming on our door.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Timidly we opened it, and there stood the prototype of <i>Liberty,
Leading the People</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We gathered
from the impassioned speech delivered by the young woman that The Soviet Union
had been attacked by Nazi Germany and we must immediately station ourselves at
assigned posts and spread the news that now the war was sanctified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was no longer an Imperialist War fought
by Imperialist Nations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a war to
free the enslaved peoples of the world!</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
messenger departed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mae and I looked at
one another in bewilderment and went where we were told to go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stood for perhaps ten minutes, not
accosting anyone, and went home.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0.5in;" align="center">*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
job as a shipping clerk was seasonal and the end of the season came.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father came through and got me a job in a
scab shop that somehow was allowed to operate by the union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My task was to sort caracul skins that were
various shades of black, degrees of curliness, sheen and texture into uniform
matching piles so that a garment sewn from skins from a matched pile would
appear to have come from the same Persian lamb.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
trainer gave me all of five minutes of rapid-fire description and left me to
flounder&#8211;which I did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If any of my
matched piles would have been used for a garment, the garment would have
created a sensation with any potential customer&#8211;a sensation of dismay at least.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I lasted for two hours and got bupkes for my
efforts, which actually were Brobdingnagian.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
father didn't give up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think perhaps
he wanted to have a son in the elite echelons of fur.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He himself was of the lowest stratum: a nailer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be a cutter was like being a member of
the priestly class in Judaism&#8211;a Cohen, as distinguished from the progressively
lower Levy (which I actually am) and the lowest&#8211;the Israel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father would have kvelled if I succeeded
in becoming not merely a nailer or an operator, so he got me apprenticed as a
cutter at J. B. Gross and Frishman, where he worked.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">As
an apprentice I was contracted to start work at seven-fifty the first week, ten
the second week and then increments of five until I reached scale which was
seventy-five dollars a week&#8211;a munificent amount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd wet down and stretch lynx-dyed white fox skins for Mr.
Frishman and watch him cut out the eyes and ears.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After I became proficient in watching him, I was given a knife
and allowed to cut eyes and ears in profusion under declining supervision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eventually I was allowed to slice stretched
and nailed mink skins.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This approached
artistry and as time went on, this task was turned over to J. B. Gross's
immigrant cousin who had fled Hungary.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I cut fox collars and eyes and ears and the weeks passed and my salary
increased and a week before Christmas I reached scale&#8211;and was laid off.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
gave a few days to the war effort by cutting donated furs that were sewn into
jackets and headgear for sailors in the merchant marine who, in the early
stages of the war were suffering a tremendous number of casualties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Convoys in the North Atlantic were sometimes
decimated by U-boats.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
brother, my wife and I acted in Irwin Shaw's <i>Bury the Dead</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mae was the young wife whose complaint was,
"Why can't I have a baby?"<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was at least four months pregnant at the time.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0.5in;" align="center">*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Some
of the first year of marriage was fun, perhaps ecstasy, but I was a tough
sonuvabich to get along with (WAS?).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was a pretty good lover though and the union bore fruit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ricky was born on February 4, l942.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I used to cause Mae to giggle with
embarrassment when my answers to questions appeared to indicate that he was a
seven-month baby, perhaps even a six-month baby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got confused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In those
days counting months was an indoor sport.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">He
was a beautiful kid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His crib was next
to our bed and one morning when Mae got up to change him, he lay in his bare
beauty as she stepped to the bureau to fumble for a diaper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that precise moment he arced a fall of
baby dew right on my upturned sleeping face.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mae chortled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was pissed.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
guess I became a warmonger after the Soviet Union was attacked, so despite the
"Day of Infamy" I was glad to see the U.S. get into the war against
Hitler.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't think I was as anxious
to fight the Japanese.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knew they were
doing monstrous things to the Chinese, and I supported a boycott
intellectually, sang:</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Please
stay in style;</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Wear
clothes made of lisle;</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Don't
buy anything Japanese.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Lisle's
three times as strong;</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Lasts
three times as long;</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Don't
buy anything Japanese.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
never wore silk anyway, but I supported the idea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Big deal!</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
were eating at Mae's folks' house in Mount Vernon that Sunday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember that Mae's mother was trying to
get me to eat carrots, which I had perversely decided I didn't like.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She persisted, I demurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got my way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Silvia and her boss, a dentist were at the dinner table.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have the sense that it was about five and
I guess Mae's father must have turned on the old-fashioned floor model radio,
and we heard FDR's voice re this "Day of Infamy."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We gasped, mumbled, postulated, predicted,
and ate.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Hy
tried to enlist a number of times, but was turned down because of his eyes, but
was finally accepted in the medics.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
remember when I was in basic training years later how I would console my
fellow-trainees as they lay prostrate during the ten-minute-breaks on a
twenty-mile march carrying sixty pound field packs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"My brother told me," I would say, "that this is
good for you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It strengthens you, gives
you stamina; you'll be happy about this one day."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Oh, how soberly they greeted my brother's
wise words.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would be flooded with
choice expletives and threatened with bodily harm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I only meant well.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Hy
was in the European Theatre during the war.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I know he saw action, but I don't remember discussing his experiences
much with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, I think that
once he went overseas I didn't see him, or hear much from him until he essayed
poultry farming in the U.S.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He wrote a
few letters to Mae while I was in the army, said he was arranging for her to
get an allotment from him to make her life easier and she did receive one
check, at least, before other demands must have made him rethink his
generosity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't think Mae ever held
it against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hy had a pretty
blameless personality.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">During
the year we moved up to 1180 Sherman Avenue in The Bronx.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was when Mae became pregnant with what
eventually became Ricky.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How vulnerable
babies make us!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mae's milk disagreed
with him and Ruthie suggested that we change his name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rank superstition, but we changed our plans
to name him Barry and named him Richard Barry to fight off the evil spell in
exchange for living under a pall of shame for the rest of our lives whenever we
remembered our cowardice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Love and Fear
have much to answer for.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">When
I was laid off by J. B. Gross and Frishman, I couldn't find anything in fur; it
was the slack season, but the shipyards were hiring.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Big money was to be made in defense so I wanted my share.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got a job as a pipefitter's helper at Todd
Shipyard in Kearny, New Jersey.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
on the night shift so I'd eat breakfast at five p.m. and started work about
seven-thirty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was given an hour
overtime so I got home about five o'clock in the morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were refitting the Ile de France so it
could be used as a troopship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
usually tired, but not from working.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
rarely worked&#8211;I wanted to, but I was usually told to get lost along with a lot
of the workers.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
made friends with a fellow who lived in the same building as John Dos Passos,
who was calumnized by the Communists as a Trotskyite, who were The Enemy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More hatred was leveled at them than at the
Capitalists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was nonplussed about the
whole leftist movement that had schisms within schisms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In my naive simplicity I thought that
"In Unity there was strength," but traitors rated special
dispensations of hatred.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I've
forgotten my friend's name, but I owe a great deal to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He introduced me to clam broth in Jersey
City, to clams in a giant indoor market in downtown New York, taught me what
prairie oysters were (the testes of bulls, I guess), showed me another segment
of the world.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">He
explained to me that we were working under a 'Cost-Plus' contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever it cost in labor and materials
would be used to calculate the profit the company received.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The more they paid out, the more they
made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I worked five nights, took out my
ire on my pregnant wife, who recognizing my breaking point was near offered me
a palliative that worked in reverse.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Lovingly she mixed my favorite drink&#8211;a bottle of milk flavored with cocoa
and sugar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I smashed it in the sink and
refused to go back to the non-work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mae
cleaned up the debris and eventually I apologized.</p>

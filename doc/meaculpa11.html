<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Mae
was always the breadwinner in the family.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I was laid off, or perhaps even when not, I'd do the cooking&#8211;I
could always fry steak and onions and my mother had taught me how to make a
stew.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also knew how to get down on my
hands and knees and scrub the linoleum.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I've always modified<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the lessons
I've been taught so early in our marriage I soaped the floor by balancing on
floor brushes<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and skating merrily about
on my bare feet, sliding and slipping and<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>occasionally falling, but joyfully content that I was contributing
something.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
decided to sign up for unemployment insurance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I sat in an office being questioned by a clerk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly I became extremely uncomfortable
with the idea that I had to strip myself of a last shred of what?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>of dignity? pride?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever it was too much.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I stood up and left.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0.5in;" align="center">*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Though
I was 3A it looked like I was due to be drafted so I decided to beat them to
the draw.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I enlisted in the USMS, The
United States Maritime Service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
called for the physical and I guess I was kind of excited because the doctor
said my blood pressure was too high.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
suggested I take a walk and then come back.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
walked and worried, because I much preferred being on the sea than the land
even though the sailor's life was extremely unsafe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Merchant mariners were making good money, but were dying faster
than the regular soldiers and sailors.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Convoys were top targets for the U-boats.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whenever I wanted something badly, I'd get uptight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time when I got back to the doctor, he
okayed my blood pressure and I was practically in.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">In
fact, in a few days my orders came and I was sworn into the United States
Maritime Service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was not a
government employee exactly, so I got paid fifty dollars a month with no
allotment for my wife.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
moved from Sherman Avenue down to Bleeker Street in Greenwich Village.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I reported to Sheepshead Bay, Mink
moved in with Mae and after a while Virginia did also.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rationing was in and Mae remonstrated with
Virginia mildly about her butter consumption.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This led to some uncomfortable feelings, which became too evident on one
of my leaves and I lost my temper and smacked my sister-in-law in the face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this beginning, I was forced to flee my
mother-in-law's wrath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If she'd had a
horsewhip, I would have felt its effects.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don't think she ever forgave me, but I had the feeling Virginia did.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
USMS was a lot like the CCC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
fellows were about the same age and generally the same character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rough, the tough, the bigots moiled and
roiled this unmelting pot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I met
another Jewish fellow there who hid his origins for fear of being beaten up by
ever-present sadists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Courage doesn't
really mean standing up and being knocked down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We slept in three-tiered metal bunks, got up early, proved our
patriotism by saluting the flag, were given a barrage of tests to discover what
talents might be hidden by our rough exteriors, drilled and went to classes.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
scored well enough to be chosen to enter the radio-operator's class.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first we studied the mathematics of
ships' stores and about supplies in general.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We all took the regular sailors' courses:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>knot-tying, rowing, climbing rope nets, standing watch through
the sleep-inducing hours, fitness exercises, boxing the compass and so forth;
etcetera, etcetera etcetera</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Despite
the fact that The War was supposed to be against fascism and nazism and for
human rights, we had our rat supply of American fascists, nazis, and bigots
galore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I almost got into a fight with
one in the mess hall who was expounding on the Jews who got the cushy
jobs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think what stopped me was my
fear of authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It wasn't my
Superego; it was the punishment I might have to undergo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I cooled, and cooled the rotten
whatever-he-was, who at least, for the nonce, stopped his diatribe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our seats weren't assigned, so I never saw
him again.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Minki
helped Mae at home and Mae went to work as a receptionist Girl Friday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We discovered that somehow unwittingly our
union was going to bear another fruit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mae would have to quit work and there was no other income.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We pondered the possibility of my finishing
my training, which might take six months or so, when a fortuitous (not
fortunate) event occurred.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
instructor in the radio-operator's class deviated from him proper teaching duty
to confide in us that too many of THOSE people were getting away with murder,
were shirking their patriotic duties, were sucking up to gullible authorities
and making scads of money while we truly patriotic citizens were getting
screwed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I found myself on my feet
sputtering to the effect that what he was saying was false and I was a Jew and
knew many Jews here and in the Merchant Marine and as I spoke I felt lame.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He shrugged and said he didn't mean me and
he apologized if he'd hurt my feelings and some other nonsense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My friends consoled me with phrases that
poured gasoline on my feelings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I found
I was alone in a walled prison.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Mae's
need and my disgust prompted me to apply for discharge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was sent to the chaplain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was a Catholic, I believe, who tried to
talk me out of leaving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I guess that
was his job.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He thought my reasons were
insufficient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I quit.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Judy
was born at about 11:00 p.m. on October 23rd, 1944.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another hour and I would have been twenty-five years older than
her to the day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While Mae was in labor,
I was in Murray Cohen's house, the rich husband of my cousin, Dorothy, nee
Waldman, watching my rich Uncle Irving and my father play pinochle with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wasn't very good at the game.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't have afforded it anyway.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Babies
aren't beautiful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pregnant women
are.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Babies cry and I never really
found out how to handle them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They're a
prey to changing fashions in psychology.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Don't cater to them; cater to them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pick them up; let them cry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All
the old-wive experts warned against spoiling them while the baby would turn
red, white and blue and blare more irritatingly than my inhuman, impatient,
tortured ears could stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judi was a
champ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was floored.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She chose special times for her torture
spells.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That moment when I'd drop off
to sleep after congratulating myself that I'd succeeded in appeasing her
monstrous needs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There's a special
quality in an infant's cry that grates upon the sturdiest nerves and mine were
not the sturdiest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mae had to bear the
brunt of the baby's onslaughts.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0.5in;" align="center">*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
was drafted into the U.S. Army on February 22, 1945.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was sitting next to a black fellow before the briefing and
separation into allotted destinations took place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we conversed I commented on how tough it was to be a Jew in
among anti-semites.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said, "You
think that's bad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How about me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm a black Jew from Harlem."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
was sent to Fort Dix.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My companions
were all white.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The army was a lot like
the C's and the USMS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We saw some
indoctrination films; we were to recognize that The Soviet Union had been, was,
and would be our friend, since it was now a staunch ally against the Japs and
the Germans.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I palled around with a guy
who was night blind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't know if
they kept him in the Service.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">In
a short while I found myself in Camp Gordon, Georgia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We learned quickly to police the area or else&#8211;.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Punishment was the withholding of
recreational opportunities and doing some menial labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This type of intimidation meant little to me
until Mae came down to Augusta with the kids.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I think a rating brings out the sadism in some characters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My corporal must have noticed how hard I tried
not to capture his attention, because he proceeded to try to trip me up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't remember missing out on seeing Mae
and the kids, but I paid in worry.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Get
caught doing something suspiciously like mopping up barracks, quivering at
attention as an officer inspected our handiwork (always expecting to repeat our
efforts before our freedom to pursue whatever recreation we enjoyed), wriggling
under machine gun bullets, artillery shells, BAR's, Maggie's drawers, twenty
mile hikes with 60 pound field packs, Roosevelt's death, trip to POE,
Anti-semitism's effect on Jewish friend, paratroopers, Germany or Japan,
Liberty ship, steel deck's effect on hip-bone, gambling on ship, going down to
mess, lights on, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Mindoro, young pimps, Luzon, rating,
officers and Nco's at Gordon, rats in ditch and in sleeping bag, bowling badly,
home because of hardship, picked up at Fort Dix by Uncle Irving, my father, Mae
and Ricky, "Into the long tunnel I go in my GI car."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1946, chicken farming.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>termites, lice, mites.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Snatches:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a protest meeting in Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was like being at the rim of a large (200
foot) crater with a wooden platform in its center where soldiers were
complaining about not being sent home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was a kind of yellowish glow over the entire proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A crowd of soldiers rimmed the crater and
applauded as speakers expressed their sentiments.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Mindoro:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our first stop across the Pacific.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We landed in the late afternoon and were
informally marched in the early evening through lanes of jerrybuilt display
stalls lighted by candles and electric torches.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cries of young boys selling their sisters' sexual wares in a
pidgin English, small bananas, strange fruit, medium sized people.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
slept in large tents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a large
ditch running along the rear of the tents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We lazed about for a while.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
we went to mess, children would be standing near the garbage cans where we
dumped our scraps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They'd beg for
whatever we had left.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
did nothing for a while but laze about.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I read and nibbled on crackers in my sack and dozed to find that
something was in the sack with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
ejected a rat violently.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">On
to Luzon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tents again, but
assignments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was in the 86th Signal
Corps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could type.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They promoted me to a T/5 and occasionally
gave me some work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Usually I wrote what
I pleased.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">One
of the fellows was looking for bowlers and I had averaged about one fifty at
home so I told I'd join up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
terrible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't break a
hundred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I guess I can blame it on the
rough alleys, but I was terribly chagrined.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Mae
was trying to get me home on a hardship excuse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It came through and I was filled with the fear that I'd never
live to get home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd be impossibly
careful crossing roads, examine each eruption on my body for plague, and
generally died a thousand deaths.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Samuel
Royall lived in Virginia and raved about Colonial Village.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I taught him how to play gin and he'd nag me
to play with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think I came home
on the -------- Wilson, a Liberty Boat.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was sometimes touch-and-go as to whether I'd become seasick on the
climb back from the mess deck which was deep in the bowels of the ship.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">In
basic there were tanks that rolled over our foxholes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We put atabrine in our canteens to combat malaria.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I developed crotch itch and was treated with
Salycylic Acid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were tested at night
with compasses in order to find out how well we could orientate ourselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I failed miserably.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
score on the Army IQ test was high enough for me to be eligible for OCS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I acted the perfect fool in front of the
Colonel and his aides.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I answered the
questions hoping I was giving the wrong types of answers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't see staying in the army any
longer than I had to.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
were given the opportunity to go to Germany and, I think, being paratroopers,
or going to Japan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I kind of wanted to
be a paratrooper and I felt my real enemy was Germany, but I equivocated and
gave up heroic thoughts.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
was discharged in April, 1946.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
may be wrong about this:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In June we had
bought a chicken farm in Estelle Manor, N.J. with five thousand dollars
borrowed from Mae's father.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
first night on the farm I was alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was a chilly night and my lack of fundamental household knowledge had me
freezing on a cot all night because I was ignorant about turning on the heat in
the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We bought the farm from a
couple named Gor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man was a
forbidding figure who never smiled throughout the proceedings.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Our
neighbors across the road were pleasant people who raised gladiolus.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
old man loved land and trees and brought us gifts of mushrooms he
collected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was full of woodland
knowledge:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Only eat mushrooms
that grow on wood."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His name was
Tcherino and his outrage at Abe Plattis's remark that "I'd just as well
cover all my land with asphalt so that nothing grew on it." threw him into
a fit.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">That
first night I was visited by garrulous Abe.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My eyes were closing, I wasn't able to follow what he was talking about
and he stayed and stayed and stayed.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
were supposed to help each other and somehow I didn't come through with what he
expected and he became sullen and wouldn't speak to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was his way of punishing me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was creative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He built economical coops, worked hard, but always had time to
shmooz (when he wasn't put out about something).</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
ordered our feed from the Farmer's Union Cooperative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were invaded by Perry and Esther Kaiser when we were totally
unprepared for company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perry made some
crack which embarrassed my wife, but was easily excused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were about twenty years older than we
were and were communists which brought us closely together.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">One
of the first things I experienced in the army was the orientation program which
propagandized us in an opposite direction from which anti-Soviet propaganda had
been marching for over twenty years.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Suddenly we were made to realize that the Soviet Union was our friend
and the politics were practically commendable.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Perry
and Esther had two children: Eddie and Freddy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Eddie joined ROTC in college and though a shadow lingered on his
ambitions because of his parents' political bent, with the help of a rabbi he
was accepted in the army OCS, became a captain, a major and eventually I don't
know what.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Freddy became a fireman (?)</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Through
the Kaisers we met the Persoffs&#8211;Abe and Gertie&#8211;whose house we eventually
bought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a tree nursery.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">(Much
later)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We'd gone to New York City with
the three kids.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was probably
December or later and after we'd enjoyed whatever it was that we enjoyed in
those days we were at the subway station preparing to go to the Port Authority
when a bum stopped us to warn us that those tiny flakes of snow were going to
be "This high" indicating about four feet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We didn't sneer; we were too polite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About three hours later we were stuck in a long line of cars on
Route 54 with the snowplows laboring to relieve us of our predicament.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We moved on and when I reached Hammonton and
stopped in a gas station I found I couldn't shift gears.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eventually I discovered ice was blocking my
attempt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We eventually reached our farm
(the tree nursery) which had a four hundred foot driveway and the snow said no
as I dove<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the nose of my car into the two
to three foot snowbank at our entrance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We all got out and plowed our way to the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I carried David on my back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was probably about six, but it was
cumbersome; it was cold; and we hurried to our sanctuary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We staggered inside and I collapsed on the
bed gasping for breath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have never
before or since been so exhausted.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">At
the age of thirty-nine I had had a heart attack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This snow occurrence happened after that.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
all recovered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm not sure if we lit a
fire in our fireplace then.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Hy
and Mathy visited us and decided to buy a farm near us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hy became very active in the Progressive
Party and was well-loved be many of the blacks in a community (?) near us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was a very gutsy guy who was willing to
stand up and fight for the freedom of all people.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Unfortunately
chicken farming was not Hy's bag.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mathy
seemed to be able to handle all the vicissitudes of life, but Hy became
moody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He decided to buy a car and it
was a lemon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm not sure if I
encouraged him to buy it, but I was never a bright buyer myself.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Hy
would write some parodies and we would act things out for Progressive Party and
Farmer's Union affairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was a good
speaker and always an activist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never
saw him on a soapbox speaking on the issues of the day, but I know he did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I admired and envied him this ability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He'd been writing things for as long as I
knew he could write.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He wrote a parody
of "Red Sails in the Sunset" called "Red Nails On My Girl
Friend"</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 40px; text-indent: 0.5in;">Red
nails on my girl friend</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 40px; text-indent: 0.5in;">so
awful to see</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 40px; text-indent: 0.5in;">whenever
I spy them</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 40px; text-indent: 0.5in;">chill
runs through me </p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
forget the rest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a political
parody on Gallagher and Sheehan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had
some pleasure in doing some skits, but the luck of chicken farming was turning
bad and he was caught in a squeeze that other farmers suffered from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our political platform called for price
supports for eggs and lower feed prices.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With eggs dropping and feed skying the poultry farmer's profit margin
became negative.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Hy
went back to France and dubbed some movies, acted in some, and became actively
engaged in radical-progressive politics.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">He
came back to the U.S. with Henri when his son was seventeen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hy was better known than I was in my own
town, Highland Park.</p>

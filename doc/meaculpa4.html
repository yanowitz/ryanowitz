<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
got a job once.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was about twelve and
I was standing outside of the Second Ave heater at Second Street and Second
Avenue looking at the pictures on a sandwich board that was leaning against the
wall in the front of the lobby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A giant
of a man with a painted face, wearing a tall hat and red and white striped
trousers spoke to me.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"You
want a job?"</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"A
job?"</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Yeah,
you want to work?"</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"I
go to school."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"After
school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Three hours a day and three
dollars a week."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">That
was a lot of money!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Awright.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When do I start?"</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Tomorrow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be here four o'clock."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
told my mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She wished me good luck
and on the morrow I became a working man.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My boss sent me out to get him a sandwich and when I was coming back
into the theater a kid a little older than I stopped me.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"You
woikin' for him?"</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Yeah,"
I smiled.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Did
he try anything yet?"</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
was puzzled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"What d'yeh
mean?"</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"You'll
find out."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He walked away.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
boss wanted me to help him make up when I came backstage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He gave me a small brush with some chalky
stuff on it and told me to brush his forehead with it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was much too tall to reach and he pulled
a stool over and told me to stand on it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was eager to do a good job and was involved in doing what I thought he
wanted me to do, when I felt his hand on me where I had never had anybody
else's hand except my mother's when I was too young to wash myself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I pushed his hand away.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"What's
the matter?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You worried about your
petzahleh?" His face was wreathed in a sickly grin.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"I
don't like it, that's all. "</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">He
didn't touch me again and when I got down from the stool, I left him and the
theater and my first job.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
had another strange experience when I was even younger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since my mother worked and we kids would
come home after school and my mother worried about what might happen in the
house or on the street, she arranged for us to attend a day nursery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was next door to the Hebrew School.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember eating breakfast there and some
cookies and milk after school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
remember falling dreamfully in love with a girl named Sylvia Silberstien, who
never gave me any indication of reciprocation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I'd sit on the first floor fire-escape, she lived on Fourth Street also,
and I'd sing to myself, "Why does my heart skip a beat, when I hear a
little footstep on the street?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's a
precious little thing called love."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And once in a while I'd get a heartflutter when I spied her.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">That's
not the strange experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Hebrew
Yard was at ground level and the day nursery had a cellar which went below
ground level.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The basement windows of
the day nursery were of opaque wired glass and came above ground level.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day when I came out to the Hebrew Yard I
noticed a group of boys standing close to one of the windows that was tilted
open from the top about four inches.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were very quiet, but they were smiling with relish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The window was pulled shut before I got to
it, but Oscar Rosenblatt, about eleven, was anxious to share his nouveau
experience with everyone.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The girls are takin' showers down
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They're using cups to compare their
tits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tillie had to use a soup
bowl!" he chortled.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Oscar
was a tough little kid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He copied his
older brother, Izzy, or "Shorty," who was supposed to be real
tough.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were pretty friendly with
me though I didn't understand why.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
evening, they invited me to the movies.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was easily convinced to go and I was really interested in what was
going on on the screen when Izzy said something I didn't catch and he took my
hand and said, "Grab this," and it took me an eternal second to
realize that he had placed my fingers around his member.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I pulled my hand away, and both he and Oscar
laughed.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
didn't know how to leave and they didn't do anything else so I stayed to the
end of the movie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we got out, Izzy
said, "Come on up to the house."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
tried to make an excuse, but was persuaded by camaraderie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we got into their apartment, Izzy
started fooling around with Oscar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
didn't understand what was going on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Izzy unzipped his fly and said to Oscar, "Come on, boy, do your
daily dozen."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing happened,
but I finally stuck by a lame excuse and left and never went anywhere with them
again.</p>

</span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
had three fights in my life and avoided a lot more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One was with a kid named Oscar Popper, who took a dislike to
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was about my size and a little
heavier.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I think it was in the summer
of my thirteenth year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had been bar
mitzvahed and had followed the prescribed rituals for about a month, I guess,
but laygen tvillum was too tedious and I was never heavily religious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was a late sexual bloomer and hadn't
pursued all the inquiries that eventually became important to me.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Oscar
persisted in trying to rile me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
wouldn't get physical with me, but he taunted me with one very stupid remark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He'd say, "Hahaha, your mother had six
kids.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You know what that means, don't
you?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Your father did it to her six
times."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Even
in my naive state I knew his logic was way off and I didn't really want to
fight, but I said, "Shut up!" and he said, "You wanna
fight?" and I had to say, "Yeah," and so we fought in the Hebrew
Yard and some adult stopped the fight and everybody told me I won.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know I hit him a few times and he hit me a
few times, but at least he didn't fling this taunt at me anymore.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
had a grudge fight in Surprise Lake Camp, which was set up by one of the
counselers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We wore big, heavy gloves
and I was declared the winner there also, but I never really counted that as a
fight.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">There
was a kid named Marvin Gold who also developed an antagonism towards me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This happened in eighth grade.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He'd say something insulting, for instance
when we were going up the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd
stop and turn, and he'd sneer, and then I'd continue upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He became more and more of a nuisance and I
didn't want to fight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, I
couldn't take it anymore and we had a slight wrestling match on a staircase
landing, at which time we contracted to have a fist fight.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">He
was at least my size and he hit me a couple of times and I hit him a couple
more as hard as I could because he had gotten me sore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fight took place in Tompkins Square Park
near Junior High School 64.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We fought
for a while before an adult stopped us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I didn't feel hurt and the next day was Friday and Marvin didn't come to
school.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">On
Monday he showed up and my eighth grade English teacher asked him why his face
was all black and blue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said he'd
been sparring with his uncle and his uncle got a little rough.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After class the teacher asked me to
stay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't know what for until she
smiled and patted my hand and said, "Good.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He's deserved it for a long time."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0.5in;" align="center">*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
mother's health didn't improve.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were
on relief and eked out an existence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sometimes my father's court-ordered ten dollars a week would come for a
while.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of my great failings was
that I didn't know what was going on.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
brother was the mensch; my mother let me know it often enough, so I didn't
bother my head about family problems.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The selfisheh chaleryeh was wrapped up in himself and his hobbies.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">One
day Sammy Feinberg, my best friend, who shared a great deal of my love for
living things, was fishing with me in the 69th Street Lake in Central
Park.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were elaborate semicircular
steps leading down into the lake and thick, low stone fences, each from ten to
twenty feet long with rounded, sculptured tops, that ran along the lake in a
straight line at that end.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
were sitting on one of these parapets, fishing for sunnies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We used a piece of black cotton tied to a
bent pin that we'd shape with our front teeth.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We used a flour and water mix for bait.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We didn't have much luck at first and then Sammy caught a nice, aquarium
sized one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He put it in a milk bottle
only half full of water because we knew fish needed oxygen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A little later he caught another nice one
and then I finally caught one&#8211;a little big&#8211;but I didn't want to throw it
back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I caught another and I had two in
my milk bottle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I suggested we quit so
that the fish would live, but Sammy got a bite and had another one.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">He
wanted to quit then, but I didn't want to.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He caught another one and then I did, but he still had one more than I
did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I caught up to him, but the fever
was on me and I caught another one almost immediately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wanted to quit because the sunnies were
gulping for air at the top of the water in my bottle, but Sammy had to catch
up; and by the time he did, we had sunnies packed like sardines in the milk
bottles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There wasn't one alive in my
bottle when I got home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mom scaled
them, cut off their heads and fins and ground them up bones and all and made
some delicious fishballs out of them and food always came in handy.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0.5in;" align="center">*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">When
I was fifteen I kissed my first girl, and it almost spoiled sex for me for
life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If kissing could be so obnoxious,
what was I in for?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was "The
Girl Next Door."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sound romantic?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Poor kid, she had a heck of an acne
affliction and my only conversation previous to her seduction of me took place
with me sitting on the toilet in the hall and her opening the imperfectly
latched door and catching me with my pants down.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Hey!"
I shouted spiritedly.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Oh!"
she replied.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
can't blame her completely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was a
late bloomer and ready for experimentation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She waylaid me in the hallway and said, "Hi, ya wanna go up on the
roof?"</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">What
could I say, "No?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No, I
couldn't; we went and at her invitation I sat down on one of the low walls that
separated the tenement buildings and she sat next to me.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was nervous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I really didn't know what to do.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She helped me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She snuggled up
to me and put her arm around my back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
had to reciprocate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then she turned her
face towards me; I turned mine; she brought her lips close to mine; our lips
met. . .</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">One
thing that has had the tendency to drive me insane throughout my life is
girlish laughter in my presence directed at me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think her name was also Sylvia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She laughed and she laughed and she laughed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps it was only three seconds, but it
was much too long.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"You
smacked your lips," she snickered.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
thought that was the way you kissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
tried it her way and it was not pleasant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don't know how I got away from her, but I always held the toilet door
tightly closed and I never went up on the roof without scouting it first.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
roof was a great place to go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
five stories up and I would crawl to the edge until I could just barely see the
street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My stomach would turn, but I'd
stay there for a few moments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tried
getting up on my knees and was proudly fearful when I succeeded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't bring my foot close to the edge
though.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
used to walk down to Battery Park to go to the Aquarium, a wonderful building
that had been converted from an armory to the greatest collection of aquatic
creatures that has ever existed in the world.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I've been to a lot of sorry imitations so I speak with authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were sharks, electric eels that lit
electric lights, seals whose echoing honks bounced resoundingly from the walls
of the giant building, and colorful fish from all over the world.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All around the edge of the sea lion tank was
a live setup about two feet wide that demonstrated the life history of the
salmon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First the brilliant red eggs,
then the hatching fry separated from their older siblings by progressively
higher steplike falls, which they jumped as they grew strong enough.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">One
day on the way to the Aquarium, as I was passing Wall Street, I found myself
being trailed by a large, hairy dog.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
always loved animals so I reached over&#8211;his head came to my hip&#8211;and petted him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He wouldn't leave me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
insisted on following me, which may have influenced me to change my mind about
the Aquarium.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned around and
started back home.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">It
was natural for me to call him, "Buck."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had read <i>Call of the Wild</i> and he looked like a
"Buck."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was so friendly
and so playful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He'd take my hand in
his mouth and chew it carefully; I'd wrestle with him, he'd snap at me
playfully.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was my dream of a dog.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Nobody
was home when I got upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I figured
Buck was hungry so I looked for something, anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were some old, boiled potatoes and I tossed them piece by
piece to him and he caught them and came back for more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ran out of them and found an old piece of
dried rye bread as hard as rock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
tried to cut a piece off the piece; the knife slipped and I finally learned the
difference between arteries and veins.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I hit a gusher in my left wrist&#8211;the scar is still there&#8211;and clamped down
hard with my right hand to stop the flow of blood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It took time, but I held it hard and then wrapped a rag around
it, and while Buck commiserated with me, coagulation took place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were a couple of times I was fooled,
but in the end, it ended.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
didn't want to tell my mother, so I cleaned up, wrapped a clean rag around my
wrist, and when she asked, I said it was nothing.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">That
night I took Buck up on the roof and tied him to a pole.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had a collar, but no information on
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the morning I decided to walk to
Central Park with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had no leash;
I didn't need one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He'd come when I'd
call or whistle and I was having a lot of fun with MY dog.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I usually walked up to Broadway and about
Tenth Street and then would walk along Broadway to Twenty-Third Street and then
along Fifth Avenue to the park.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Today I
walked to Third Avenue and Fourteenth Street and then I started walking on the
north side of Fourteenth towards Seventh Avenue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were next to the Fourteenth Street Armory when my world
crumbled a little.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fourteenth Street
has always been a high traffic street and I became frightened when Buck suddenly
angled across it to the accompaniment of horns and squealing brakes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I started to chase after him and then I
stopped.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">He
was safe on the other side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
jumping all over a young man who was hugging and petting him with joy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Buck was doing flipflops when I finally came
up to them.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Is
that your dog?" I asked.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"It's
the family's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were so worried.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did you find him?"</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"I
guess he found me," I said woefully.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Come
with me," he said.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"I know my
father'll give you a reward."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"No,"
I said, and turned and walked away.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Thanks,"
he yelled after me.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
turned around; he waved and started walking toward the West Side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Buck didn't pay any attention to me.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
wrist throbbed a bit for a couple of days and I washed it and put iodine on the
stab wound and figured it would heal up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All my cuts had always healed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After about five days my seventh grade English teacher, Mrs. Schrank,
called me to the front of the room while the class was writing a composition.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Why
are you holding your arm?" she asked softly.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Holding
my arm?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said looking at
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Oh, it hurts a little."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Roll
up your sleeve.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ohmygod!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mason," she whispered to a boy in the
front row.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"I want you to go with
Yanowitz to Mr. Kirke's office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
hurry."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Mr.
Kirke, the principal, took one look and sent me, along with Mason, to the
emergency ward of Beth Israel Hospital, which was about five blocks away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They took care of me pretty quickly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctor told me if I'd waited another
day, I would probably have lost the arm.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don't remember what he did to me, but the swelling gradually
disappeared and in a few days I was okay.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Momma
was kind of upset with me and shook her head in bewilderment as she laced into
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Vuss is the mehr mit
dir?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hust nisht kyne seichel?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Oy vais mir, Ich cholesh aveck!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>("What's the matter with you?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Haven't you got any sense?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm choking to death!") I guess she was
a little worried.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Actually,
it was just another contribution to her burdens.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had a wracking cough.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was losing weight, yet she kept trying to make a go of things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was always a fighter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember witnessing, or perhaps hearing so
often that I believed I'd witnessed, her collecting money on the street for an
unfortunate family thrown out of their apartment by their landlord.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nickels and dimes were contributed by the
poor to give the dispossessed at least a temporary possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We walked the tightrope between possession
and dispossession too often ourselves.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Momma could pull out all the stops when she had to.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
never enjoyed going to Orchard Street with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was always ashamed of her continual bargaining.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the depths of the depression "a
penny saved was a penny earned" with a vengeance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And did my mother fight for pennies!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She never bought anything on Orchard Street
at the price quoted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I imagine she was
not unique.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Sometimes
things get kaleidoscopic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember my
mother's old world passionate screaming on the beach in Coney Island when
Sylvia disappeared among the crowd under the boardwalk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She ran this way and that, not caring about
the spectacle she made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What tortured
imaginings must have been racing through her head!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when she found the eight-year-old, what carryings-on!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Huggings and kissings and cryings and
caressings.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">One
of the happy moments in my life was when I got the grippe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I lay on the kitchen cot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I guess I was about ten or so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Momma knelt on the floor and lifted my head
to feed me spring-chicken soup.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I
finished, she kissed my cheek, caressed my head and made me feel so
gooooooood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I really relished that
illness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had no pain; I was just
lethargic and receptive to love.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
remember she had a date once.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She gave
herself a permanent with curling irons she heated over the gas flame.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She wasn't as proficient as a daily or
monthly user; she winced as she burned her scalp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She bought a bright new flowery dress of some soft material that
blew in the wind, put on lipstick and rouge and became a new woman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was about forty then, and some friend of
hers was trying to work out a match.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Oh, did we kids praise Momma!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
know it made her happy and it made us happy too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of us could conceive that such a change could take
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not that we thought of
her as ugly, but she never wore anything but old housedresses, her hair was
always parted in the middle and hung about an inch below her ears, she never
wore lipstick, and she was always very pale.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Nothing
came of the date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, I don't even
remember if it was cancelled at the last minute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother never painted her face, got a permanent, or wore that
dress again.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">She
tried to take in boarders once to earn more money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think that worked for a couple of weeks and ended.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
moved from 57 East Fourth Street to Eldridge Street, which is further downtown
and cheaper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We lived about a half
block from Houston Street, where there were concrete handball courts, another
game I didn't excel in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went to
Seward Park High School and played a lot of hooky.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had plenty of opportunities for it with my mother sick so
often.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sammy and Benny visited me from
Fourth Street and became much more friendly than I with the gang of girls and
fellows around there.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
made the second team on the football squad and actually got into one game for
about five minutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was all due to
some strategy that Gellert, the captain of the team pulled off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was the first team left tackle and I was
his sub, so when he pretended to be hurt, I had to take his place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the first play the Boys' High team didn't
pay attention to me, and I went through the line and tackled the passer before
he could get rid of the ball, causing him to lose about ten yards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was my moment of glory.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
was a thorn in the side of Gellert in a few ways.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order to develop agility, the football team played
basketball.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was told to guard him and
I did too good a job of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
complained and said something about it not being legal for me to play so
tight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My ignorance had me lay back
somewhat, enough for him to get a basket.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was never well-informed about sports.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was asked to come out to play for a semi-pro team and while lining up
on defense, a line coach yelled something to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The play was
called and two hundred pounds of helmet smashed my chest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was it as far as football was
concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My chest hurt for many
months after that.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">In
my English class the teacher had arranged an elocution contest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a girl who recited something with
such emotion that it made me cringe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
did "Fleurette," by Robert W. Service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This girl was so thrilled with my rendition that she made it a
point to compliment me at various times and places.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would nod my thanks and move on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gellert came to me and threatened me if I didn't leave HIS girl
alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt no attraction for her,
poor thing, so I was properly cowed.</p>

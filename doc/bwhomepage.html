<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">INTRODUCTION
AND SUMMARY</span></span></p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">You may remember seeing <a href="http://www.britinfo.net/index_Borehamwood.htm">Borehamwood</a>&nbsp;
(or Boreham Wood) as the Hertfordshire partner
location, with Elstree,&nbsp;of
major English <a href="http://www.elstreefilmstudios.co.uk/studiohistory.aspx">movie
studios</a>, including EMI and <a href="http://www.borehamwoodtimes.co.uk/features/history/display.var.822838.0.mgm_was_king_of_the_castle.php">MGM</a>
(which closed in 1970 and merged with EMI, though I
don&#8217;t think because of the troubles described here). &nbsp;In
1969 I was hired at a UK college of further education (FE) in
Borehamwood, a commuter train ride from my home in London. &nbsp;FE
apparently <a href="http://www.dfes.gov.uk/furthereducation/index.cfm?fuseaction=content.view&amp;CategoryID=20">still
exists</a> in England , but has probably changed in the last 40
years. (Borehamwood College itself seems to have changed name to <a href="http://www.uk-universities.net/Colleges/England-Hertfordshire-Borehamwood.html">Oaklands
College</a>.) &nbsp;When I was there, FE covered a number of
post-secondary education aims, of which two were relevant to me:</span></p>
<ul style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt;">A-level
and O-level classes to prep for national exams self-selected students
who had finished regular school, may have passed one or more A- or
O-level exam, but needed&nbsp; more exam qualifications to qualify
for
college or university</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt;">One-day-a-week
educational requirements for secondary school-leavers<big><a href="bwhomepage.html#note1">*</a><a name="sourceofnote1"></a></big>
who had signed up for
apprenticeship programs in industry: most of the day was spent in
technical courses, but the students were also required to attend one
section of "liberal studies" (among its various names), which was to be
a <span style="font-style: italic;">non-</span>technical
class to broaden their minds<br>
</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">I was hired to teach exam prep
courses (in English literature) and liberal studies courses to various
apprentice groups.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">A few months into my first term,
fall 1969, I assigned a text (Alex Haley's <span style="font-style: italic;">The Autobiography of Malcolm X</span>) to which the school authorities objected.
&nbsp;My department chair told me not to teach it, and I refused to obey.
After
many months of wrangling, meetings, appeals, newspaper articles, union
involvement and (to my mind) official duplicity within the college, I
technically failed probation for not being able to get along with my
superiors. &nbsp;All new full-time FE teachers had
a mandatory 1-year probation period. &nbsp;It was almost unheard of
to
fail probation. &nbsp;During my struggle, some teachers from
elsewhere
in the country said that they thought I had had&nbsp;bad luck
working
at Borehamwood--that what happened to me there would almost certainly
not have happened anywhere else.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">While
the specifics of my experience are not universal, the overall arc has
been told a thousand times in history and
fiction:&nbsp;&nbsp;opposition by officialdom (in this case
based on
rumors) to the action of an&nbsp;underling/</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">refusal of the underling to obey/</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">ensuing
battle of many words and documents that becomes public/official
manipulation in the background/almost always (in real
life),&nbsp;victory
for&nbsp;officialdom. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The shenanigans behind and during
my particular battle included:</span></p>
<ul style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt;">A
reference letter from Fresno State College (now Fresno State
University), received at Boreham Wood after I had begun teaching, that
included a statement by a Fresno official
who said that while he hadn't known me, he heard that while teaching
English there in 1965-66 I had publicly advised students to break laws</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt;">A report
by one or more unidentified
fellow Borehamwood faculty that they heard me preaching Marxism (or
maybe black power) to at least one of my (all-white, as I recall)
classes</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt;">A
15-page statement sent by me in January, 1970, to the college's board
of governors, an&nbsp;uncool action within English pedagogical
culture</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Student
access to this statement, which I facilitated, and its wider public
distribution as a result</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt;">My
objection during a faculty meeting to the principal's use of the
expression, "nigger in the woodpile"; other faculty later discussed my
concern with some soul-searching about&nbsp;the propriety of a
phrase
most of them had apparently always taken for granted <br>
</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt;">A
spontaneous comment by me that prompted the college principal to stop a
meeting with him and other officials (including, I think, a union rep
or two): as the principal explained how ungrateful I was after he had
hired me despite handicaps (my being American?&nbsp;Jewish?--I
never
found out; I always thought they wanted the prestige of having an M.A.
on the staff) that would have stopped others from doing so, I
interrupted
and
said approximately, "And the violins played and chirping birds sang"<br>
</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Anonymous
rumors and one or two anonymously mailed threats</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Memos
(late in the sequence of events) from my frustrated head of department
complaining about my eating habits and putting my feet on my desk while
teaching<br>
</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">I
write those bullets with a light tone, but this period caused me
enormous anguish, threatened my ability to keep my British work
permit--and my ability to pay&nbsp;my share of living expenses for
the
apartment I was sharing at the time with my honey,--and ended up
putting me on tranquilizers for a couple of weeks.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Next: <a href="bwfresnobckgr.html">Background (Fresno State College)</a></span></p>
<hr style="width: 100%; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; height: 2px;">
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><a name="note1"></a><big><big><a href="bwhomepage.html#sourceofnote1">*</a></big></big>It
was my observation that
numerous working class kids of various races and ethnicities viewed the
school-leaving age (16 at that time,&nbsp;moved up from 15 a year
or
two earlier,&nbsp;I think)
as a date to look forward to, after which they would never have to
attend school again but would be earning&nbsp;meaningful money.
&nbsp;(I should note that in general salaries were very low in
England
at that time. &nbsp;Americans would still take a trip to London
just to
shop. &nbsp;My annual salary as a full-time teacher in 1969-70 was,
I
think, roughly $2000; at Fresno four years earlier it had been $6700.)
&nbsp;I also had the impression, both from FE and a state school
where
I briefly taught, that valuing education was not in vogue in the
working class, but I had a narrow data sample. &nbsp;To get into an
apprentice program was a triumph; to learn that you had to spend a day
a
week back in school was disillusioning; and to find yourself stuck for
an hour or more of that day in a class not obviously relevant to your
work was embittering--not unlike getting into college
in the US and then finding you had to take freshman English comp.
&nbsp;The behavior of these kids in FE varied widely and seemed
culturally related to their chosen apprenticeship program.
&nbsp;Radio
repair boys, for example, had especially low status and were terrors
with me;&nbsp;I dreaded those
classes. &nbsp;Another job category which I can't
remember,&nbsp;of
higher
perceived status, were pussycats and fun to teach. &nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Had
I, however, been a more knowledgable and experienced teacher, perhaps I
could have managed radio-repair-type kids better; my great friend,
Harry Newland, a bulwark of support throughout my troubles at
Borehamwood, got along great with the radio repair guys: he taught
classes in their actual trade, and was himself &nbsp;quite
down-to-earth and from a working-class background. &nbsp;I have a
vague, perhaps false, memory that in the midst of my troubles he made
an at least partly successful plea with these kids to behave well with
me.</span> </span></p>

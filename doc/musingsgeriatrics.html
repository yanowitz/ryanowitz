<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-right: 0.7pt; text-indent: 13.5pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">The hardest substance in the human body is the white enamel
of the teeth. With age, it wears away nonetheless, allowing the softer, darker
lay<span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">ers underneath to show through. Mean</span>while,
the blood supply to the pulp and the roots of the teeth atrophies, and the flow
of saliva diminishes; the gums <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">tend to
become inflamed and pull away from the teeth, exposing the base, mak</span>ing
them unstable and elongating their appearance, especially the lower ones.
Experts say they can gauge a person's <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">age
to within five years from the exam</span>ination of a single tooth&#8212;if the
person has any teeth left to examine.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-left: 0.5pt; text-indent: 12.25pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Scrupulous dental care can help <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">avert tooth loss, but growing old gets in </span>the way. Arthritis,
tremors, and small strokes, for example, make it difficult to brush and floss,
and, because nerves become less sensitive with age, people may not realize that
they have cav<span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">ity and gum problems until
it's too late. </span>In the course of a normal lifetime, the muscles of the
jaw lose about forty per cent of their mass and the bones of the mandible lose
about twenty per cent, becoming porous and weak. The ability to chew declines,
and people shift to softer foods, which are generally higher in fermentable
carbohydrates and more likely to cause cavities. By the age <i>of </i>sixty,
Americans have lost, on average, a third of their teeth. After eighty-five,
almost forty per cent have no teeth at all.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0.25pt 0.5pt 0.0001pt 0.7pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0%; text-indent: 12.25pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Even as our bones and teeth soften, <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">the rest of our body hardens. Blood ves</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">sels, joints, the muscle and valves of the </span>heart, and even the
lungs pick up substantial deposits of calcium and turn stiff. Under a
microscope, the vessels and soft tissues display the same form</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-right: 0.5pt; line-height: 11.75pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">of calcium that you find in bone. When </span>you reach inside an elderly patient
during surgery, the aorta and other major vessels often feel crunchy under your
fingers. A recent study has found that <span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">loss
of bone density may be an even bet</span>ter predictor of death from atheroscle<span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">rotic disease than cholesterol levels. As </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">we age, it's as if the calcium flows out of </span>our
skeletons and into our tissues.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-left: 0.5pt; text-indent: 12pt; line-height: 11.75pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">To
maintain the same volume of blood flow through narrowed and stiffened blood
vessels, the heart has to <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">generate increased
pressure. As a result, </span>more than half of us develop hypertension by the
age of sixty-five. The heart <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">becomes
thicker-walled from having to </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">pump
against the pressure, and less able </span>to respond to the demands of
exertion. The peak output of the heart decreases steadily from the age of
thirty. People <span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">become gradually less able to
run as far or </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">as fast as they used
to, or to climb a flight </span>of stairs without becoming short of breath.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-left: 0.5pt; text-indent: 12pt; line-height: 11.75pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">Why we age is the subject of vigor</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">ous debate. The
classical view is </span>that aging
happens because of random wear and tear. A newer view holds that aging is more
orderly and genetically driven. Proponents of this view point out that animals
of similar species and exposure to wear and tear have markedly different life
spans. The Canada <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">goose has a longevity of
23.5 years; the </span>emperor goose only 6.3 years. Perhaps animals are like
plants, with lives that are, to a large extent, internally governed. Certain
species of bamboo, for <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">instance, form a
dense stand that grows </span>and flourishes for a hundred years, flowers all
at once, and then dies. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-left: 1.2pt; text-indent: 11.75pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">The idea that living things shut down </span>and not just wear down has received
substantial support in the past decade. Researchers working with the now famous
worm <i>C. elegans </i>(two of the last five Nobel Prizes in medicine went to
scientists doing work on the little nem<span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">atode)
were able to produce worms that </span>live more than twice as long and age
more slowly by altering a single gene. <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">Scientists
have since come up with sin</span>gle-gene alterations that increase the <span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">life spans of <i>Drosophila </i>fruit flies, mice,
</span>and yeast.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.25pt 0.0001pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0%; text-indent: 11.5pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">These
findings notwithstanding, scientists do not believe that our life spans are
actually programmed into us. After all, for most of our hundred-thousand-year
existence&#8212;all but the past couple of hundred years&#8212;the average life span of
human beings has <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">been thirty years or less.
(Research sug</span>gests that subjects of the Roman Empire had an average life
expectancy of <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">twenty-eight years.) Today,
the average </span>life span in developed countries is almost eighty years. If
human life spans depend on our genetics, then medicine has got the upper hand.
We are, in a way, freaks living well beyond our appointed time. So when we
study aging what we are trying to understand is not so much a natural process
as an unnatural one. Inheritance has surprisingly <span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">little influence on longevity. James Vau-</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">pel, of the Max Planck Institute for De</span>mographic Research, in
Rostock, Germany, notes that only six per cent of <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">how long you'll live, compared with the </span>average, is explained by
your parents' longevity; by contrast, up to ninety per <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">cent of how tall you are, compared with </span>the average, is explained
by your parents' height. Even genetically identical <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">twins vary widely in life span: the typical gap is more than fifteen
years.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-left: 1.2pt; text-indent: 11.5pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">If our genes explain less than we imag</span>ined, the wear-and-tear model may ex<span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">plain more than we knew. Leonid Gav-</span>rilov,
a researcher at the University of Chicago, argues that human beings fail the
way all complex systems fail: ran<span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">domly and
gradually. As engineers have </span>long recognized, many simple devices <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">do not age. They function reliably until </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">a critical component fails, and the whole </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">thing dies instandy. A windup toy works </span>smoothly
until a gear rusts or a spring breaks, and then it doesn't work at all. But
complex systems&#8212;power plants, say&#8212;have to survive and function de<span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">spite having thousands of critical compo</span>nents.
Engineers therefore design these <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">machines
with multiple layers of redun</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">dancy:
with backup systems, and backup </span>systems for the backup systems. The
backups may not be as efficient as the <span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">first-line
components, but they allow the </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">machine
to keep going even as damage </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">accumulates.
Gavrilov argues that, within </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">the
parameters established by our genes, </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">that's
exactly how human beings appear </span>to work. We have an extra kidney, an
extra lung, an extra gonad, extra teeth. <span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">The
DN A in our cells is frequently dam</span>aged under routine conditions, but
our <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">cells have a number of DNA repair sys</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">tems. If a key gene is permanently dam</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">aged, there are usually extra copies of the </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">gene nearby. And, if the entire cell dies, </span>other
cells can fill in.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-right: 1.2pt; text-indent: 11.75pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">Nonetheless, as the defects in a com</span>plex system increase, the time comes when
just one more defect is enough to <span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">impair
the whole, resulting in the condi</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">tion
known as frailty. It happens to power plants, cars, and large organizations.
And </span>it happens to us: eventually, one too <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">many joints are damaged, one too many </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">arteries calcify. There are no more back</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">ups. We wear down until we can't wear </span>down anymore.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-right: 1.2pt; text-indent: 11.75pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">It happens in a bewildering array of ways. Hair grows gray,
for instance, simply because we run out of the pigment cells that give hair its
color. The <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">natural life cycle of the
scalp's pigment </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">cells is just a few
years. We rely on stem </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">cells under
the surface to migrate in and </span>replace them. Gradually, however, the <span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">stem-cell reservoir is used up. By the age </span>of
fifty, as a result, half of the average <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">person's
hairs have gone gray.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.7pt 0.0001pt 0.95pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0%; text-indent: 12pt; line-height: 11.75pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Inside
skin cells, the mechanisms that clear out waste products slowly break down and
the muck coalesces into a clot of gooey yellow-brown pigment known as
lipofuscin. These arethe age spots we see in skin. When lipofuscin accumulates
in sweat glands, <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">the sweat glands cannot
function, which </span>helps explain why we become so sus<span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">ceptible to heat stroke and heat exhaus</span>tion
in old age.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-right: 0.7pt; text-indent: 12pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">The eyes go for different reasons. The lens is made of
crystallin proteins that are tremendously durable, but they <span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">change chemically in ways that diminish </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">their elasticity over time&#8212;hence the far</span>sightedness
that most people develop beginning in their fourth decade. The <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">process also gradually yellows the lens. </span>Even
without cataracts (the whitish <span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">clouding of
the lens caused by excessive </span>ultraviolet exposure, high cholesterol,
diabetes, cigarette smoking, and other unhelpful conditions), the amount of
light reaching the retina of a healthy sixty-year-old is one-third that of a
twenty-year-old.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 1.45pt 0.0001pt 0.5pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0%; text-indent: 12pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">I spoke to Felix Silverstone, who for </span>twenty-four years was the senior
geriatrician at the Parker Jewish Institute, in New York, and has published
more than a hundred studies on aging. There <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">is,
he said, "no single, common cellular </span>mechanism to the aging
process." Our bodies accumulate lipofuscin and oxygen free-radical damage
and random DNA mutations and numerous other microcellular problems. The process
is gradual and unrelenting. 'We just fall apart," he said.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 1.45pt 0.0001pt 0.5pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0%; text-indent: 12pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">This is not an appealing prospect, and </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">people naturally
prefer to avoid the subject of their decrepitude. There have </span>been dozens of best-selling books on
aging, but they tend to have titles like <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">'Younger
Next Year," "The Fountain of </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">Age,"
"Ageless," "The Sexy Years." Still, </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">there are costs to averting our eyes from </span>the
realities. For one thing, we put off <span style="letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">changes
that we need to make as a society. </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">For
another, we deprive ourselves of op</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">portunities
to change the individual expe</span>rience of aging for the better.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.7pt 0.0001pt 1.45pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0%; text-indent: 12pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">For
nearly all of human existence, <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">people died
young. Life expectancy im</span>proved as we overcame early death&#8212; <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">in particular, deaths from childbirth, in</span>fection,
and traumatic injury. By the <span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">nineteen-seventies,
just four out of every </span>hundred people born in industrialized <span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">countries died before the age of thirty. It </span>was
an extraordinary achievement, but <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">one that
seemed to leave little room for </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">further
gain; even <i>eliminating </i>deaths be</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">fore
thirty would not raise over-all life ex</span>pectancy significantly. Efforts
shifted, therefore, to reducing deaths during <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">middle
and old age, and, in the decades </span>since, the average life span has contin<span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">ued upward. Improvements in the treat</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">ment and prevention of heart disease, re</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">spiratory illness, stroke, cancer, and the </span>like
mean that the average sixty-five-<span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">year-old
can expect to live another nine</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">teen
years&#8212;almost four years longer than </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">was
the case in 1970. (By contrast, from </span>the nineteenth century to 1970,
sixty-<span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">five-year-olds gained just three years
of </span>life expectancy.)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.95pt 0.0001pt 0.25pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0%; text-indent: 11.5pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">The
result has been called the "rect-<span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">angularization"
of survival. Throughout </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">most of human
history, a society's popu</span>lation formed a sort of pyramid: young children
represented the largest por<span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">tion&#8212;the
base&#8212;and each successively </span>older cohort represented a smaller and
smaller group. In 1950, children under <span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">the
age of five were eleven per cent of the </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">U.S. population, adults aged forty-five to </span>forty-nine were six
per cent, and those <span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">over eighty were one
per cent. Today, we </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">have as many
fifty-year-olds as five-year-</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">olds .
In thirty years, there will be as many </span>people over eighty as there are

We cling to the <span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">notion of retirement at sixty-five&#8212;a rea</span>sonable
notion when those over sixty-<span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">five were a
tiny percentage of the population, but completely untenable as they </span>approach
twenty per cent. People are <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">putting aside
less in savings for old age </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">now than
they have in any decade since </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">the
Great Depression. More than half of the very old now live without a spouse, </span>and
we have fewer children than ever <span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">before&#8212;yet
we give virtually no thought </span>to how we will live out our later years
alone.</p>

Despite a rapidly growing el</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">derly population, the number of certified

medicine are </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">plummeting, while fields
like plastic sur</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">gery and radiology
receive applications in</span>record numbers. Partly, this has to do <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">with money&#8212;incomes in geriatrics and a</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">dult primary care are among the lowest </span>in
medicine. And partly, whether we admit it or not, most doctors don't like
taking care of the elderly.</p>

doctors are turned off <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">by geriatrics, and
that's because they do </span>not have the faculties to cope with the Old

Old Crock is deaf. The Old Crock has poor vision. The Old Crock's memory might
be somewhat impaired. With the Old <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">Crock,
you have to slow down, because he asks you to repeat what you are say</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">ing or asking. And the Old Crock doesn't </span>just

is, however, a skill to it, a de<span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">veloped

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 1.7pt 0.0001pt 0.5pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0%; text-indent: 12pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">The geriatrics clinic&#8212;or, as my hos</span>pital calls it, the Center for Older
Adult Health&#8212;is only one floor below <span style="letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">my
surgery clinic. I pass by it almost every </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">day, and I can't remember ever giving it a </span>moment's thought. One
morning, however, I wandered downstairs and, with <span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">the permission of the patients, sat in on a </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">few visits with Juergen Bludau, the chief </span>geriatrician.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-right: 0.95pt; text-indent: 12pt; line-height: 11.75pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">"What brings you here today?" the <span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">doctor asked Jean Gavrilles, his first pa</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">tient of the morning. She was eighty-five </span>years
old, with short, frizzy white hair, <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">oval
glasses, a lavender knit shirt, and a </span>sweet, ready smile. Small but
sturdy in appearance, she had come in walking steadily, her purse and coat
clutched <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">under one arm, her daughter
trailing be</span>hind her, no support required beyond her mauve orthopedic
shoes. She said <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">that her internist had
recommended that </span>she come.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 1.2pt 0.0001pt 0.7pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0%; text-indent: 11.75pt; line-height: 11.75pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">About
anything in particular? the doctor asked.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 1.2pt 0.0001pt 0.7pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0%; text-indent: 11.75pt; line-height: 11.75pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">The
answer, it seemed, was yes and no. The first thing she mentioned was a
lower-back pain that she'd had for months, which shot down her leg and <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">sometimes made it difficult to get out of </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">bed or up from a chair. She also had bad </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">arthritis, and she showed us her fingers, which
were swollen at the knuckles and bent out to the sides with what's called a </span>swan-neck
deformity. She'd had both <span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">knees replaced a
decade earlier. She had </span>high blood pressure "from stress," she
<span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">said, and handed him her list of medica</span>tions.
She had glaucoma and needed to <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">have eye
exams every four months. She </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">never
used to have "bathroom problems," </span>but lately, she admitted,
she'd started <span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">wearing a pad. She'd also had
surgery for colon cancer and, by the way, now had a </span>lung nodule that the
radiology report <span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">said could be a
metastasis&#8212;a biopsy was </span>recommended.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 1.2pt 0.0001pt 0.7pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0%; text-indent: 11.75pt; line-height: 11.75pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Bludau
asked her to tell him about <span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">her life. She
said that she lived alone, except for her Yorkshire terrier, in a single-</span>family
house in the West Roxbury section of Boston. Her husband died of <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">lung cancer twenty-three years ago. She </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">did not drive. She had a son living in the </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">area who did her shopping once a week </span>and
checked on her each day&#8212;"just to <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">see if
I'm still alive," she joked. Another </span>son and two daughters lived farther
away, but they helped as well. Other<span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">wise,
she took care of herself quite capa-</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">bly.
She did her own cooking and clean</span>ing. She managed her medicines and <span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">her bills. "I have a system," she said.
She </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">had a high-school education, and
during </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">the war she'd worked as a
riveter at the </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">Charlestown Navy
Yard. She also worked </span>for a time at the Jordan Marsh depart<span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">ment store in downtown Boston. But that </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">was a long time ago. She stuck to home </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">now, with her yard and her terrier and her </span>family
when they visited.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-left: 0.25pt; text-indent: 11.75pt; line-height: 11.75pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">The doctor asked her about her day <span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">in great detail. She usually woke around </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">five or six o'clock, she said&#8212;she didn't seem to need much sleep
anymore. She </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">would get out of bed as
the back pain al</span>lowed, take a shower, and get dressed. Downstairs, she'd
take her medicines, feed the dog, and eat breakfast. Bludau <span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">asked what she had for breakfast. Cereal </span>and
a banana. She hated bananas, she <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">said, but
she'd heard they were good for </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">her
potassium, so she was afraid to stop. </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">After
breakfast, she'd take her dog for a </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">little
walk in the yard. She did chores&#8212; </span>laundry, cleaning, and the like. In
the <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">late morning, she took a break to watch
"The Price Is Right." At lunchtime, she had a sandwich and orange
juice. If the </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">weather was nice,
she'd sit out in the yard </span>afterward. She'd loved working in her garden,
but she couldn't do that anymore. The afternoons were slow. She might do some
more chores. She might<span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">nap or talk on the
phone. Eventually, she </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">would make
dinner&#8212;a salad and maybe </span>a baked potato or a scrambled egg. At night, she
watched the Red Sox or the <span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">Patriots or
college basketball&#8212;she loved </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">sports.
She usually went to bed at about </span>midnight.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 2.15pt 0.0001pt 0.7pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0%; text-indent: 12pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">Bludau asked her to sit on the exam</span>ining table. As she struggled to climb
up, her balance teetering on the step, the doctor held her arm. He checked her
blood pressure, which was normal. <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">He
examined her eyes and ears and had </span>her open her mouth. He listened to
her heart and lungs briskly, through his stethoscope. He began to slow down
only when he looked at her hands. The nails were neatly trimmed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-left: 13.45pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">"Who cuts your nails?" he asked.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-left: 13.2pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">"I do," Gavrilles replied.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 1.2pt 0.0001pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0%; text-indent: 11.75pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">I
tried to think what could be accomplished in this visit. She was in good
condition for her age, but she faced everything from advancing arthritis and
incontinence to what might be metastatic colon cancer. It seemed to me that,
with just a forty-minute visit, Bludau needed to triage by zeroing in on either
the most potentially life-threatening problem (the possible metastasis) or the
problem that bothered her the most (the back pain). But <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">this was evidendy not what he thought. </span>He asked almost nothing
about either issue. Instead, he spent much of the exam looking at her feet.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 1.2pt 0.0001pt 1.7pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0%; text-indent: 12.5pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">"Is that really necessary?" she asked, </span>when he instructed her to take off her
shoes and socks.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.5pt 0.0001pt 1.9pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0%; text-indent: 12pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">'Yes," he said. After she'd left, he told me, 'You
must always examine the feet." </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">He described a bow-tied gentleman who </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">seemed dapper and
fit, until his feet revealed the truth: he couldn't bend down </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">to reach them, and
they turned out not to </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">have been cleaned in weeks, suggesting </span>neglect and real danger.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-left: 2.15pt; text-indent: 12pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Gavrilles had difficulty taking her <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">shoes off, and, after watching her strug</span>gle a bit, Bludau leaned
in to help. When he got her socks off, he took her feet in his hands, one at a
time. He inspected them inch by inch&#8212;the <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">soles,
the toes, the web spaces. Then he </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">helped
her get her socks and shoes back </span>on and gave her and her daughter his
assessment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.5pt 0.0001pt 3.1pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0%; text-indent: 12.25pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">She was doing impressively well, he said. She was
mentally sharp and physi</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">caJly strong. The danger for her was los</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">ing what she had.
The single most serious </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">threat she faced was not the lung nodule </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">or the back pain. It
was falling. Each year, </span>about
three hundred and fifty thousand <span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">Americans
fall and break a hip. Of those, </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">forty
per cent end up in a nursing home, </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">and
twenty per cent are never able to walk </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">again.
The three primary risk factors for </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">falling
are poor balance, taking more than </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">four
prescription medications, and mus</span>cle weakness. Elderly people without <span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">these risk factors have a twelve-per-cent </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">chance of falling in a year. Those with all </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">three risk factors have almost a hundred-</span>per-cent
chance. Jean Gavrilles had at <span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">least two. Her
balance was poor. Though </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">she didn't
need a walker, he had noticed </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">her
splay-footed gait as she came in. Her feet were swollen. The toenails were un</span>dipped.
There were sores between the <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">toes. And the
balls of her feet had thick, </span>rounded calluses.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 1.45pt 0.0001pt 0.5pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0%; text-indent: 12.25pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">She was also on five medications. Each was undoubtedly
useful, but, to<span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">gether, the usual side
effects would in</span>clude dizziness. In addition, one of the blood-pressure
medications was a di<span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">uretic, and she seemed
to drink few liq</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">uids, risking
dehydration and a worsen</span>ing of the dizziness. Her tongue was <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">bone dry when Bludau examined it.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.7pt 0.0001pt 0.25pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0%; text-indent: 12.95pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">She
did not have significant muscle <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">weakness,
and that was good. When she </span>got out of her chair, he said, he noted that
she had not used her arms to push <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">herself
up. She simply stood up&#8212;a sign </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">of
well-preserved muscle strength. From </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">the
details of die day she described, however, she did not seem to be eating nearly
enough calories to maintain that strength. </span>Bludau asked her whether her
weight <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">had changed recendy. She admitted
that </span>she had lost about seven pounds in the previous six months.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-left: 0.25pt; text-indent: 12pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">The job of any doctor, Bludau later <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">told me, is to support quality of life, by </span>which he meant two
things: as much <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">freedom from the ravages of
disease as </span>possible, and the retention of enough function for active
engagement in the world. Most doctors treat disease, and <span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">figure mat the rest will take care of itself. </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">And if it doesn't&#8212;if a patient is becom</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">ing infirm and heading toward a nursing </span>home&#8212;well,
that isn't really a <i>medical </i>problem, is it?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.95pt 0.0001pt 0.7pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0%; text-indent: 11.75pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">To a geriatrician, though, it <i>is </i>a medical
problem. People can't stop the aging </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">of their bodies and minds, but there are </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">ways to make it
more manageable, and to avert at least some of the worst effects.So </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">Bludau referred
Gavrilles to a podiatrist, </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">whom he wanted her to visit once every </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">four weeks, for
better care of her feet. He </span>didn't
see medications that he could <span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">eliminate, but
he switched her diuretic to </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">a
blood-pressure medicine that wouldn't </span>cause dehydration. He recommended <span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">that she eat a snack during the day, get all </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">the low-calorie and low-cholesterol food out of
me house, and see whether family </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">or
friends could join her for more meals. </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">"Eating
alone is not very stimulating," he </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">said. And he asked her to see him again </span>in three months, so that
he could make sure the plan was working.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-right: 0.25pt; text-indent: 12.5pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Nine months later, I checked in with Gavrilles and her
daughter. She turned eighty-six this past November. She is eating better, and
has even gained a pound or two. She still lives comfortably and independently
in her own home. And she has not had a single fall.<o:p></o:p></p>

a lesson about frailty. Decline remains our fate; death <span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">will come. But, until that last backup sys</span>tem inside each of us
fails, decline can <span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">occur in two ways.' One
is early and pre</span>cipitately, with an old age of enfeeble-<span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">ment and dependence, sustained primar</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">ily by nursing homes and hospitals. The </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">other way is more gradual, preserving, for </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">as long as possible, your ability to control </span>your

medical care can influence which direction a person's old age will take. Most
of us in medicine, however, don't know how to think about decline. <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">We're good at addressing specific, indi</span>vidual
problems: colon cancer, high blood pressure, arthritic knees. Give us a
disease, and we can do something about it. But give us an elderly woman <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">with colon cancer, high blood pressure, </span>arthritic
knees, and various other ailments besides&#8212;an elderly woman at risk of losing
the life she enjoys&#8212;and we are not sure what to do.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-left: 0.25pt; text-indent: 12.5pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">Several years ago, researchers in St. </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">Paul, Minnesota,
identified five hundred </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">and sixty-eight men and women over the age of seventy who
were living indepen-</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">dendy but were at high risk of becoming disabled because
of chronic health prob</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">lems, recent illness, or cognitive changes. </span>With their permission, the researchers <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">randomly assigned half of them to see a </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">team of geriatric specialists. The others were
asked to see their usual physician, who was notified of their high-risk sta</span>tus.
Within eighteen months, ten per cent of the patients in both groups had <span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">died. But the patients who had seen a ge</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">riatrics team were a third less likely to be</span>come
disabled and half as likely to develop depression. They were forty per cent
less likely to require home health services.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.5pt 0.0001pt 0.95pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0%; text-indent: 11.75pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Little
of what the geriatricians had <span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">done was
high-tech medicine: they didn't </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">do
lung biopsies or back surgery or PET </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">scans.
Instead, they simplified medica</span>tions. They saw that arthritis was
controlled. They made sure toenails were trimmed and meals were square. They <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">looked for worrisome signs of isolation </span>and
had a social worker check that the patient's home was safe.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.25pt 0.0001pt 0.95pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0%; text-indent: 12pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">How do we reward this kind of work? </span>Chad Boult, who was the lead investigator
of the St. Paul study and a geriatrician at the University of Minnesota, <span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">can tell you. A few months after he pub</span>lished
his study, demonstrating how much better people's lives were with <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">specialized geriatric care, the university closed
the division of geriatrics.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-left: 1.2pt; text-indent: 12pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">"The university said that it simply could not sustain
the financial losses," Boult said from Baltimore, where he is now a
professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">On average, in Boult's study, the geriat</span>ric
services cost the hospital $1,350 more per person than the savings they <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">produced, and Medicare, the insurer for the
elderly, does not cover that cost. It's </span>a strange double standard. No
one insists that a twenty-five-thousand-dollar pacemaker or a coronary-artery
stent save money for insurers. It just has to <i>maybe </i>do people some good.
Meanwhile, the twenty-plus members of the <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">proven
geriatrics team at the University </span>of Minnesota had to find new jobs.
Scores of medical centers across the <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">country
have shrunk or closed their ge</span>riatrics units. Several of Boult's col<span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">leagues no longer advertise their geriat</span>ric
training for fear that they'll get too many elderly patients.
"Economically, <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">it has become too
difficult," Boult said.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.25pt 0.0001pt 1.7pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0%; text-indent: 12pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">But the finances are only a symptom </span>of a deeper reality: people have not
insisted on a change in priorities. We all like new medical gizmos and demand
that policymakers make sure they are paid for. They feed our hope that the
troubles of the body can be fixed for <span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">good.
But geriatricians? Who clamors for </span>geriatricians? What geriatricians do&#8212;
<span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">bolster our resilience in old age, our ca</span>pacity
to weather what comes&#8212;is both difficult and unappealingly limited. It <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">requires attention to the body and its al</span>terations.
It requires vigilance over nutrition, medications, and living situa<span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">tions. And it requires each of us to con</span>template
the course of our decline, in <span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">order to make
the small changes that can </span>reshape it. When the prevailing fantasy <span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">is that we can be ageless, the geriatrician's </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">uncomfortable demand is that we accept </span>we
are not.<o:p></o:p></p>

Felix Silverstone, understanding human aging has been the work of a lifetime.
He was a national leader in geriatrics for five decades. But he is <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">now himself eighty-seven years old. He </span>can
feel his own mind and body wearing down, and much of what he spent <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">his career studying is no longer abstract </span>to
him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.25pt 0.0001pt 0.5pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0%; text-indent: 12pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Felix
has been fortunate. He didn't have to stop working, even after he suffered a
heart attack in his sixties which cost him half his heart function; <span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">nor was he stopped by a near-cardiac ar</span>rest
at the age of seventy-nine. "One <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">evening,
sitting at home, I suddenly be</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">came
aware of palpitations," he told me. </span>"I was just reading, and a
few minutes later I became short of breath. A little <span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">bit after that, I began to feel heavy in the </span>chest. I took my
pulse, and it was over two hundred." He is the sort of person who, in the
midst of chest pain, would <span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">take the
opportunity to examine his own pulse. "My wife and I had a little discus</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">sion about whether or not to call an am</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">bulance. We decided to call."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-left: 0.5pt; text-indent: 11.5pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">When
Felix got to the hospital, the doctors had to shock him to bring his heart
back. He'd had ventricular fibrillation, and an automatic defibrillator had to
be installed in his chest. Within a few weeks, though, he felt well again, and
his doctor cleared him to return to work full time. He stayed in medical
practice after the attack, <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">multiple hernia
repairs, gallbladder sur</span>gery, arthritis that ended his avid piano
playing, compression fractures of his aging spine that stole three full inches <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">of his once five-foot-seven-inch height, </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">and hearing loss. "I switched to an elec</span>tronic
stethoscope," he said. "They're a nuisance, but they're very
good."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-left: 0.25pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Finally,
at eighty-two, he had to retire. The problem wasn't his health; it <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">was that of his wife, Bella. They'd been </span>married
for more than sixtyyears. Felix had met Bella when he was an intern <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">and she was a dietitian at Kings County </span>Hospital,
in Brooklyn. They brought up two sons in Flatbush. When the boys left home,
Bella got her teaching certification and began working with children who had
learning disabilities. In her seventies, however, retinal disease diminished
her vision, and she had to stop working. A decade later, she became almost
completely blind. Felix no longer felt safe leaving her at home alone, and in
2001 he gave up his practice. They moved to Orchard Cove, a retirement
community in Canton, Massachusetts, outside Boston, <span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">where they could be closer to their sons. </span>"I didn't think I
would survive the <span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">change," Felix said.
He'd observed in his </span>patients how difficult the transitions of <span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">age could be. Examining his last patient, packing
up his home, he felt that he was </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">about
to die. "I was taking apart my life </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">as well as the house," he recalled. "It was </span>terrible."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-left: 0.25pt; text-indent: 11.3pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">We were sitting in a library off Orchard Cove's main lobby.
There was light streaming through a picture window, tasteful art on the walls,
white-upholstered Federal-style armchairs. It was like a nice hotel, only with
no one under seventy-five walking around. Felix and Bella have a two-bedroom
apartment with forest views and plenty of space. In the living room, he has his
grand piano and, at his desk, piles of <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">medical
journals that he still subscribes </span>to&#8212;"for my soul," he said.
Theirs is an independent-living unit. It comes with housekeeping, linen
changes, and dinner each evening. When they need to, they can upgrade to
assisted living, which provides three prepared meals and up to an hour with a
personal-care assistant each day.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-left: 0.25pt; text-indent: 11.3pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">This was not the average retirement <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">community, but even in an average one </span>rent runs thirty-two
thousand dollars a <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">year. Entry fees are
typically sixty thou</span>sand to a hundred and twenty thousand dollars on top
of that. Meanwhile, the median income of people eighty and older is only about
fifteen thousand dollars. More than half of the elderly who live in
long-term-care facilities go <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">through their
entire savings and have to </span>go on Medicaid&#8212;welfare&#8212;in order to afford it.
And, ultimately, the average American spends a year or more of his old age
disabled and living in a nursing home (at twice the cost), which is a
destination Felix desperately hopes to avoid.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0.25pt 0.25pt 0.0001pt 0.5pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0%; text-indent: 12.25pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">He tries to note the changes he's ex<span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">periencing objectively, like a good ger</span>iatrician. He notices
that his skin has dried out. His sense of smell has diminished. His night
vision has become poor. He tires easily. He has begun to lose teeth. He takes
measures where he can. He uses lotion to avoid skin cracks; he protects himself
from the heat; he gets on an exercise bike three times a week; he sees a
dentist twice a year.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.25pt 0.0001pt 0.95pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0%; text-indent: 12pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">He's
most concerned about the changes in his brain. "I can't think as <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">clearly as I used to," he said. "I used
to </span>be able to read the <i>Times </i>in half an hour. Now it takes me an
hour and a half." Even then, he's not sure that he has understood as much
as he did be<span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">fore, and his memory gives him
trouble. </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">"If I go back and look
at what I've read, </span>I recognize that I went through it, but sometimes I
don't really remember it," <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">he said.
"It's a matter of short-term reg</span>istration. It's hard to get the
signal in and have it stay put."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-left: 0.95pt; text-indent: 12pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">He makes use of methods that he <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">once taught his patients. "I try to delib</span>erately focus on
what I'm doing, rather than do it automatically," he told me. "I
haven't lost the automaticity <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">of action,
but I can't rely on it </span>the way I used to. For example, I can't think
about some<span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">thing else and get dressed and </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">be sure I've gotten all the way </span>dressed."
He recognizes that the strategy doesn't always work. He sometimes told me the
same <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">story twice in a conversation. The
lines </span>of thought in his mind would fall into well-worn grooves and,
however hard he tried to put them onto a new path, <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">sometimes they resisted. Felix's knowl</span>edge as a geriatrician has
forced him to recognize his own decline, but that hasn't made it easier to
accept.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-left: 0.95pt; text-indent: 12pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">"I get blue occasionally," he said. "I think
I have recurring episodes of de<span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">pression.
They are not enough to disable </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">me,
but they are . . ." He paused to find </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">the right word. "They are uncomfortable." </span>What buoys
him, despite his limitations, is having a purpose. It's the same purpose, he
says, that sustained him in <span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">medicine: to be
of service, in some way, </span>to those around him. He had been in Orchard
Cove for only a few months before he was helping to steer a committee to
improve the health-care services there. He tried to form a journal-reading club
for retired physicians. He <span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">even guided a
young geriatrician through </span>her first independent-research study&#8212; a
survey of the residents' attitudes toward Do Not Resuscitate orders.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0.25pt 0.95pt 0.0001pt 0.25pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0%; text-indent: 11.75pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">More important is the responsibility <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">that he feels for his children and grand</span>children&#8212;and, most of
all, for Bella. <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">Her blindness and recent
memory trou</span>bles have made her deeply dependent. Without him, I suspect,
she would probably be in a nursing home. He helps her dress. He administers her
medicines. He makes her breakfast and lunch. He takes her on walks and to
doctors' appointments. "She is my pur<span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">pose
now," he said. Bella doesn't always </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">like his way of doing things. "We argue </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">constantly&#8212;we're at each other about a </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">lot of things," Felix said. "But we're
also </span>very forgiving."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.7pt 0.0001pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0%; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">He does not feel this responsibility to </span>be a burden. With the narrowing of his <span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">own life, his ability to look after Bella has </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">become his main source of self-worth. "I </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">am exclusively her caregiver," </span>he
said. "I am glad to be." And this role has heightened his sense that
he must be attentive to the changes in his own capabilities; he is no good to
her if he isn't honest with himself about what he can and can't do.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-left: 0.95pt; text-indent: 12.5pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">One evening, Felix invited me to dinner. The for<span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">mal dining hall was restaurant-like, with
reserved seating, table service, and jack</span>ets required. I was wearing my
white hospital coat and had to borrow a navy blazer from the maitre d'. Felix,
in a brown suit and a stone-colored oxford <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">shirt,
gave his arm to Bella, who wore a </span>blue-flowered knee-length dress that
he'd picked out for her, and guided her <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">to
the table. She was amiable and chatty </span>and had youthful-seeming eyes.
But, <span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">once she'd been seated, she couldn't
find </span>the plate in front of her, let alone the menu. Felix ordered for
her: wild-rice soup, an omelette, mashed potatoes, and mashed cauliflower.
"No salt," he <span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">instructed the
waiter; she had high blood </span>pressure. He ordered salmon and mashed
potatoes for himself. I had the soup and a London broil.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.7pt 0.0001pt 0.25pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0%; text-indent: 11.5pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">When
the food arrived, Felix told Bella where she could find the different items on
her plate by the hands of a clock. He put a fork in her hand. Then he turned to
his own meal.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.5pt 0.0001pt 0.25pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0%; text-indent: 11.75pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">Both made a point of chewing slowly. She was the first
to choke. It was the om</span>elette.
Her eyes watered. She began to <span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">cough. Felix
guided her water glass to her </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">mouth.
She took a drink and managed to </span>get the omelette down.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; text-indent: 11.75pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">"As you get older, the lordosis of your </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">spine tips your
head forward," he said to </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">me. "So when you look straight ahead it's </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">like looking up at
the ceiling for anyone </span>else.
Try to swallow while looking up: you'll choke once in a while. The prob<span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">lem is common in the elderly. Listen." I </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">realized that I could hear someone in the </span>dining
room choking on his food every <span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">minute or so.
Felix turned to Bella. "You </span>have to eat looking down,
sweetie," he said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.5pt 0.0001pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0%; text-indent: 11.5pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">A
couple of bites later, though, he <span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">himself
was choking. It was the salmon. </span>He began coughing. He turned red. Fi<span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">nally, he was able to cough up the bite. </span>It
took a minute for him to catch his <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">breath.
"Didn't follow my own advice," </span>he said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-left: 0.5pt; text-indent: 12.25pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">Felix Silverstone is, without question,
</span>up against the debilities of
his years. Once, it would have been remarkable <span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">simply to have lived to see eighty-seven. Now what's remarkable is that
he has the </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">control over his life
that he does. When </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">he started in
geriatric practice, it was al</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">most
inconceivable that an eighty-seven-</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">year-old
with his history of health prob</span>lems could live independently, care for
his disabled wife, and continue to con<span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">tribute
to research. Even today, most peo</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">ple
his age cannot live as he does.</span></p>

His mem</span>ory, for example, has not deteriorated
significantly. But he has also managed his old age well. His goal has been <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">modest: to have as decent a life as med</span>ical
knowledge and the limits of his body will allow. So he saved and did not retire
early, and therefore is not in <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">financial
straits. He kept his social con</span>tacts, and avoided isolation. He
monitored his bones and teeth and weight. And he has made sure to find a doctor
who had the geriatric skills to help him hold on to an independent life.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-left: 1.7pt; text-indent: 12pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">I asked Chad Boult, the geriatrics professor now at Johns
Hopkins, what can be done to insure that there <span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">are enough geriatricians for our country's </span>surging elderly
population. "Nothing," he said. "It's too late." Creating
geria<span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">tricians takes years, and we already
have far too few. This year, just three hundred </span>doctors will complete
geriatrics training, not nearly enough to replace the geriatricians going into
retirement, let <span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">alone meet the needs of the
next decade.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0.25pt 0.25pt 0.0001pt; background: white none repeat scroll 0%; text-indent: 11.5pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Yet Boult believes that we still have time for another
strategy: he would direct geriatricians toward training all primary-care
doctors in caring for the very old, instead of providing the care themselves.
Even this is a tall order&#8212; ninety-seven per cent of medical students take no
course in geriatrics, and the strategy requires that the nation pay
geriatricians to teach rather than to provide patient care. But, if the will is
there, Boult estimates that it would be possible to establish courses in every
medical school and internal-medicine <span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">training
program within a decade. 'We've </span>got to do something," he said.
"Life for older people can be better than it is today."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-left: 0.95pt; text-indent: 11.75pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Boult and his colleagues have yet another strategy, just in
case&#8212;a strategy that they have called Guided Care, and that doesn't depend on
doctors at <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">all. They're recruiting local
nurses for a </span>highly compressed, three-week course in how to recognize
specific problems in the elderly, such as depression, malnutrition, isolation,
and danger of falling; how to formulate a plan to remedy those problems; and
how to work with patients, families, and doctors to follow through on the plan.
In a test of the strategy, the researchers are putting the nurses to work in
primary-care practices around Baltimore and Washington, D.C., and studying the
results. It is a meagre solution for a huge problem, but it is cheap, which
insurers demand, and, if it provides even a fraction of the benefit
geriatricians have, it could nudge medical care in the right direction.<o:p></o:p></p>

know," Felix Sil-</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">verstone said
to me. "I'm a very good </span>driver."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-top: 0.25pt; text-indent: 12pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">After
our dinner together, he had to <span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">go on an
errand to refill Bella's prescrip</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">tions
in Stoughton, a few miles away, and </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">I
asked if I could go along. He had a gold </span>1998 Toyota Camry with
automatic transmission and thirty-nine thousand miles on the odometer. It was
pristine, inside and out. He backed out of a nar<span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">row parking space and zipped out of the garage. His hands did not shake.
Taking </span>the streets of Canton at dusk on a new-moon night, he brought the
car to an <span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">even stop at the red lights,
signalled when </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">he was supposed to,
took turns without a </span>hitch.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-top: 0.25pt; text-indent: 12pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">I was, I admit, braced for disaster. The </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">risk of a fatal car
crash with a driver who's </span>eighty-five
or older is more than three <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">times higher
than it is with a driver between sixteen and twenty. The very old are the
highest-risk drivers on the road. </span>This past fall, in Los Angeles, George
Weller was convicted of manslaughter <span style="letter-spacing: -0.2pt;">after
he confused the accelerator with the brake pedal and plowed his Buick into a </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">crowd of shoppers at the Santa Monica </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">Farmers' Market. Ten people were killed, </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">and more than sixty were injured. He was </span>eighty-six.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-left: 0.95pt; text-indent: 11.75pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">But Felix showed no difficulties. At </span>one point during our drive, poorly marked
road construction at an intersection channelled our line of cars almost
directly into oncoming traffic. Felix corrected course swiftly, pulling over
into the proper lane. There is no <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">saying how
much longer he will be able </span>to count on his driving ability. The day <span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">may well come when he will have to give </span>up
his keys.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-left: 0.7pt; text-indent: 11.5pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">At
the moment, though, he wasn't <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">concerned; he
was glad simply to be on </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">the road.
The evening traffic was thin as </span>he turned onto Route 138. He brought <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">the Camry to a tick over the forty-five-</span>mile-per-hour
speed limit. He had his <span style="letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">window rolled down
and his elbow on the </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">sash. The air
was clear and cool, and we </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">listened
to the sound of the wheels on the </span>pavement.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; margin-left: 13.2pt; line-height: 12pt; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">"The night is lovely, isn't it?" he said.</span></p>

<p style="font-style: italic;" class="MsoNormal">January 29, 2008</p><p class="MsoNormal">Today, my first full day back home after five days (more or
less) in Brooklyn <a href="familyalanillness.html">while my brother-in-law was recovering</a> from an e-coli
infection<a href="http://www.richardyanowitz.com/blog/?p=13#comment-55"><b style=""><span style=""></span></b></a>
that nearly killed him, I watched the 140-minute &#8220;epic&#8221; 1931 Academy Award
winner, <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1004177-cimarron/#synopsis">Cimarron</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1004177-cimarron/#synopsis"><b style=""><span style=""></span></b></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>(A web commentary notes that the only
other two westerns that won have been <i>Dances with Wolves </i>and <i>Unforgiven</i>.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One critic comments that film releases that
year were skimpy.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This is not a good movie.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But as so often with bad and mediocre films, I still found it interesting for a
number of reasons, including a kind of dialectical tension between the film&#8217;s
(and presumably most of US society&#8217;s) blindness to ethnic and racial
stereotypes towards blacks, Indians and Jews on the one hand and a relatively
progressive (for 1931) script agenda on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At some level, albeit quite clumsily, the film also addresses
women&#8217;s issues (it is based on an Edna Ferber novel I haven't read).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The film presents a series of theoretically archetypal moments, mostly occurring in a single day in 1889,
1890, 1893, 1898, 1907, 1929 and 1930.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The audience, therefore, was
looking at the history of recent decades, ending just months before the film&#8217;s
release in February.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Set in Oklahoma,
the film begins with the 1889 land rush decreed by Benjamin Harrison and
follows (I might say "exalts") the &#8220;hero&#8217;s&#8221; life (and to a lesser extent that of his wife) during
these years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
best parts of the film
are the opening Oklahoma land rush (a later film in the &#8216;30s that I
can&#8217;t
remember had a similar scene) which includes a penny-farthing bicycle
amidst the horses, wagons and running claim-seekers, and the opening
shots of each new episode, in
which we see the same view of Osage and are invited to notice how it is
changing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(We also usually see a posted front page of
the hero&#8217;s newspaper<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>,<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>and with a DVR you can pause and study the image; it is
interesting to see what articles other than the prominent one are supposedly
current&#8212;articles which sometimes seem to be confused about what date is at the
top of the paper.)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">With something approximating a pompadour, Richard Dix,&nbsp;resolutely overacting (presumably a
carry-over from silent film acting techniques), plays Yancey Cravat (I remain
puzzled about why his surname is French for &#8220;tie,&#8221; unless we&#8217;re supposed to notice
his neckwear as the film proceeds, though&nbsp;I paid no attention to it).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His wife, Sabra (another interesting name,
played by Irene Dunne in her first major role), is from somewhere &#8220;civilized&#8221;
(we know because of her parents&#8217; spiffy home) and reluctantly accompanies
Yancey to live in the new Oklahoma territory, where they run a newspaper, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Oklahoma Wigwam</span>, which
is, of course, the source of Truth for the locality (the city of Osage,
OK).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defying her parents (especially
her shrewish mother&#8212;one of many examples of unpleasant, one-dimensional women
in the film) she joins Yancey with their son (about three years old), though on
the day they arrive in Osage she desperately wants to go &#8220;home.&#8221;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">But she doesn&#8217;t.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Within days (apparently) Yancey is getting his newspaper office
built.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
day as he and Sabra are
walking in the street, a gang of toughs, whose&nbsp;leader (who
Yancey, on no&nbsp;evidence other than the look and feel of the guy,
knows
has murdered the previous newspaper editor) taunts him, in part--what
could be worse?--for wearing a white hat. &nbsp;After foreplay between
Yancey and the thug (an&nbsp;exchange of circus shots that
avoid&nbsp;wounding the antagonists), Sabra marches towards the bad guy and lectures him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yancey chides her to stop such shenanigans lest the&nbsp;town think he hides behind a woman's skirts.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Later that day, Sol Levy (Yancey is chums with all&nbsp;ordinary folk&nbsp;everywhere) is wheeling his peddler&#8217;s
cart and is harassed by the same gang of toughs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At one point Sol is shoved so that his legs are sprawled on the
ground while his upper body leans against part of some metal device that forms
a cross; Sol&#8217;s arms linger across the crossbar for a few seconds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yancey rescues him and promises that the
gang will never bother him again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
help guarantee this, the murderer incites Yancey into a gunfight (should I
mention that we later learn that Yancey notches his gun with each person
he&#8212;justifiably&#8212;kills?) and so disappears from the film, as does his gang.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">How do we know Sol is a Jew?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly not because the script ever says so directly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(To this day I notice Christians often seem
<a href="http://www.richardyanowitz.com/blog/?p=18#comments">embarrassed to say &#8220;Jew&#8221;</a> in front of Jews.)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mainly by his name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps he
has a stereotypical manner; I can&#8217;t tell.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He may have a slight Yiddish accent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He is also a worthy entrepreneur and in 1930 ends up owning a
Macy&#8217;s-like multi-story building in Osage.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And in the 1930 scene, when Edna Mae Oliver snootily explains
that her ancestors include a signer of the Declaration of Independence, which&nbsp;is why she is on a
committee to which Sol, despite his now-great wealth, was not invited,
Sol replies (approximately), &#8220;My people include the signer of the Ten
Commandments.&#8221;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">On to the Black Person&nbsp;in the film.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1890. &nbsp;Sabra is happy and has just given
birth to a daughter.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=""></span>When they first came to Oklahoma, Yancey and
his family discovered a stowaway, Isaiah, a young (teenage?) black servant of
Sabra&#8217;s parents&#8217; household.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
the
parents&#8217; house, we see him, coiffed with presumably laughable extended
and out-of-control hair (early stab at an afro?), clinging to a
chandelier&nbsp;and waving a giant leaf to fan the diners below before
hilariously
(yes, the term is ironic) losing his grip and landing on the table; he
rises with food all over his pants, and his scolding mother (ok, <span style="font-style: italic;">two </span>black people are in the film) hurries him off to be
cleaned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This boy-man who (of course) speaks like Stepin Fetchit stays with them
(we see no other black person in Osage, but we are not invited to speculate on
the lad&#8217;s feeling any lack of sexual or other companionship) until one day in
1890 when an old buddy of Yancey's, &#8220;the Kid&#8221; (we&#8217;ve met him earlier and he
promised to stay out of Osage, but never mind) rides into town with bandit
cohorts to rob the local bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
somewhat confusing gunfight ensues in which, of course, Yancey (did I mention
that he&#8217;s also a sharpshooter?) is the hero and kills the Kid despite their old
friendship. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Along the way, several
townspeople are killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But so is
Isaiah, shot as he runs to help Yancey's son and a little girl who are cowering in a nook near
the shooting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Isaiah has one of those
repetetive-dying scenes so ridiculed in Shakespeare only stretched out much more here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he&#8217;s first shot, the camera lingers as he struggles
to live but seems to die.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon we see him
struggling again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, the gunfight
over and the Kid&#8217;s remains being handled by other townspeople, Yancey walks
within inches of Isaiah, not hidden, without noticing him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As Yancey moves on, Isaiah crawls forward, gasping to the unhearing
gunfighter (in fact, in spite of the schmaltz this is a frustrating and moving
moment), &#8220;Mr. Yancey, Mr. Yancey,&#8221; and, finally, dies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The silly story-telling here is also
profoundly symbolic, though probably without awareness by the filmmakers
(Wesley Ruggles directed).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only
after
Yancey&#8212;did I mention that the cowardly Kid sneakily winged him?&#8212;has
reunited
with his family does one of the ancillary characters carry in Isaiah&#8217;s
corpse
and hand it to Yancey. &nbsp;I suspect that of all the "minority"
characters, Isaiah is the one who could be killed off precisely because
he has no real future in Osage.</p><p class="MsoNormal">1893. &nbsp;All talk is about the imminent opening&nbsp;(by Grover Cleveland in his second term)
of Oklahoma&#8217;s Cherokee territory. &nbsp;We now learn that
Yancey has a wandering urge and has never stayed in one place more than five
years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuring her that he will soon
return, he announces over Sabra&#8217;s protests that he is going to leave to stake a claim in the new territory. &nbsp;<span style=""></span>Outside, he is
joined by other excited claim seekers.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In fact, Yancey disappears for five years, during which time he
apparently fights in the Spanish-American War and returns to Osage in 1898 in a
uniform (I don&#8217;t know what rank his stripes represent).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, Sabra has taken over the&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Wigwam</span>, never removing Yancey's name from the masthead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(In Sabra we see a curious combination of a highly independent
woman when on her own but dutiful to her husband when he is around.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he marches into the house on his
return, he undermines any indignation from Sabra by quickly taking the moral
high ground, a position we are set up to expect by the happy and uncritical
welcome local men give him as, smiling, he trots his horse down the&nbsp;town's main street.<span style="">&nbsp;</span> Yancey promises their son, who must
now be about 12, a pony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their
daughter, now eight, doesn&#8217;t seem to matter yet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The son casually but with some delight takes his father&#8217;s return
for granted.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Sabra only really gets upset when Yancey learns that a
fallen woman, Dixie Lee, is on trial for some amorphous crime against good
morals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sabra and other respectable
ladies of the town are righteously looking forward to Dixie&#8217;s conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But since Dixie has no defense attorney
(and, Yancey comments, everyone is entitled to an attorney), he rushes to the
courthouse to take up that role.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Did I
mention that he&#8217;s also a lawyer?)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
turns out that knowledge of the exact case is irrelevant.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">OK, quick background: in the 1889 rush, Dixie and Yancey
want to claim the same land, and Dixie tricks him out of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a few years, she is driven away by
neighboring women who disapprove of her, though we don&#8217;t yet know (we can guess) exactly why,
and comes to Osage, where proper women scorn her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She and Yancey meet in the street, and he comforts her for a
moment by holding her hand, much to the distress of his wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Got the picture?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Of course the prosecuting attorney is a loud-mouthed,
pompous and (we later learn) corrupt fool (&#8220;the only man who can strut sitting
down,&#8221; Yancey joshes to the of course all-male jury).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Yancey&#8217;s guidance, the jury learns
that Dixie Lee is the unfortunate victim of parents who died (and who,
crucially, were of good stock, which in Yancey&#8217;s eyes pardons Dixie from
numerous crimes) and left her penniless at 15.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Immediately afterwards, she is deceived by a cad who, already married,
weds her and (we don&#8217;t know whether before or after) gets her with a child (who
conveniently dies soon after) before abandoning her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By current (1890s&#8217;, not 1931) standards she is no better than any
other fallen woman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But,
Yancey
preaches (did I mention that he&#8217;s also a preacher? and that at one
point in the film he gives an extemporaneous sermon--in the local
gambling hall--extolling ecumenicalisn? and that Sol, attending this
meeting, deferentially asks Yancey if he may stay to listen? and that
Yancey reassures Sol it's fine?) that society and the cad
are really to blame, and within minutes the jury returns a not-guilty
verdict.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">To round out this afternoon in 1898, before much longer
Sabra and Yancey are in each other&#8217;s arms and all (?) is forgiven.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal">So much for the Jew, the black
guy and the fallen woman, and Yancey's gracious (the frontier has its own version of <span style="font-style: italic;">noblesse oblige</span>) treatment of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now to Indians.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s 1907.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Yancey, now running for governor, insists on printing an editorial
supporting Indian rights, including citizenship, even though (we are encouraged
to believe) it will ruin his candidacy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sabra is once again furious with him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Did I mention that she hates &#8220;dirty&#8221; Indians but Yancey has always been
their &#8220;friend&#8221;?)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He assures her that
one day, when he is not around (spoiler alert: did I mention that he is prescient?), she will
read this editorial and know he was right.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">While Yancey was gone in the 1890s, Sabra hired the daughter
of an Indian chief to help out in the household, because, as she justifies on
the day Yancey returns, she couldn't run the paper and take care of the household without help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Early plea for day care?)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lo and
behold, by 1907 Sabra&#8217;s son and the servant have fallen in love and will be married
(of course we experience this through the son&#8217;s eyes, not his fiancée&#8217;s).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sabra has another fit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we see Yancey a few minutes later, he
is like totally mellow about the whole thing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Fast forward to 1929 (June, so we in the audience all know
the Crash is just over the horizon).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A title card informs us that Yancey has once again been gone for many years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Wigwam</span>  is celebrating its 40<sup>th</sup>
anniversary, and Sabra, now showing considerable age via white hair, celebrates
by putting Yancey&#8217;s 1907 pro-Indian plea in the editorial column.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">On to 1930.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yancey
is still away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Why
he doesn&#8217;t even
write is never explained, though Irene Dunne at one point mentions that
he just doesn&#8217;t believe in writing--this of a newspaper editor....)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sabra has been elected to Congress (!) and
is about to take up her position (though it&#8217;s June, so Osage's congressional district&nbsp;must have
been without a representative for some months), and we are at a dinner honoring
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among other things, she introduces
her son, his wife (who speaks a pithy Indian maxim followed by a gesture
resembling benediction), and their two children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also introduces her daughter and much older husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Did I mention that in 1907 the bratty
daughter wanted the good life and promised her mother that she would marry a
man with money&#8212;a promise uttered just before a street scene in which a
considerably older man in his dandy, chauffeured motorcar is jawing with&nbsp;admiring townfolk?)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">OK.<span style="">&nbsp; Speeches end. &nbsp;</span>Everyone leaves
the dinner hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For unexplained
reasons, they go to an oil field where a terrible accident has just
occurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As if by divine intervention,
everyone was saved because some wanderer did something to smother an
explosion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I
couldn't quite follow: it
sounded as though this savior had used his body to absorb a
"nitroglycerine torpedo," but was still
expiring&#8212;an intriguing understaning about the power of nitroglycerine,
though I suppose it is no more bizarre than&nbsp;some of the film&#8217;s other
improbabilities.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Who was he?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Dunno.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some old drifter named&#8230;Yance?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Coincidence that my last name starts with the same three&nbsp;letters, and here I
am in 2008 writing about this film? &nbsp;I think not!)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Irene
Dunne&#8217;s face slowly changes expression.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Could it be??<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Run, run, run across railroad tracks and other oil paraphernalia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, it is!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One last loving embrace as the eyes of a hardly recognizable Yancey with white beard
and hair momentarily flicker in recognition at his loving wife before closing&nbsp;forever.<span style="">&nbsp; Sigh. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">Fade-out
and then -in to the unveiling of a statue that represents the spirit of
Oklahoma. &nbsp;It is a statue of Yancey. &nbsp;Sigh. &nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">The end.</p>

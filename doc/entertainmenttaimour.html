<p style="font-style: italic;" class="MsoNormal">April 22, 2009</p>

<p class="stblpara">On the plane ride home from Cairo, I watched an Egyptian film, <i>Taimour
Wa Shafi&#8217;aa</i> (2007); the title is the names of the two main characters, as in "Romeo and Juliet." &nbsp;<span style=""></span>A boy and girl grow up&nbsp;in apartments down the hall from one another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They come to love each other and
expect to marry one day, but first they are going through educational programs,
he in a police academy to become a bodyguard for government ministers, she at
university.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is jealous and tries to
control her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They argue frequently and
bitterly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She keeps giving in to his
demands, then one time, when he has forbidden her to go on vacation when he
must cancel his own in order to&nbsp;guard&nbsp;a minister on vacation, she
sneaks off with her friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
accident, he encounters her while he is walking the young son of the
minister.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He accosts her and denounces
her for lying to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She is
intimidated and apologetic but also insists she was going to tell him the
truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly he looks up and sees
his young charge being kidnapped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
foils the attempt and blames her for having made him nearly fail in his job.</p>

<p class="stblpara">Finally there comes a point when she refuses to do something
he demands, and he tells her they will&nbsp;now be only brother and sister.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He will still protect her but they will
never be lovers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both, of course,
suffer during the next seven years as his career flourishes while she finishes
a Ph.D. in environmental studies and, though precociously young, soon after
becomes the government minister for the environment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>His</i> boss assigns <i>him</i> to be <span style="font-style: italic;">her</span> bodyguard.</p>

<p class="stblpara">Now she has the upper hand and makes the most of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After brief resistance, he stiffly plays the
correct bodyguard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The scenes now
become romantic comedy as they spar with each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Following her mother&#8217;s advice, she manipulates him into
re-declaring his love, as she does hers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At an international conference, they have a day or two of bliss,
and he informs her they will marry&#8212;but she must resign her government
position or it will
be too awkward for them both and especially him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(What role will he play, for example--bodyguard or husband--when he is bodyguard to a
different minister who is at a conference with her?)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She refuses to give up her career, and they
are again estranged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(The fractured
English subtitles keep having her say, in response to his efforts to suppress her independence, that he is &#8220;ruining
my personality.&#8221;)</p>

<p class="stblpara">At the next meeting of ministers at this conference, however,
she and some other ministers are kidnapped, apparently by Russians who negotiate
for the release of their boss, a drug kingpin.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Of course they have no intention of leaving the ministers alive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But our hero, now a James Bond figure who
cannot be stopped no matter how bloody and exhausted he gets, saves
everyone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nearly dying himself, we see
him recovering in an ambulance while she weeps over him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They talk, and she says she will give up her
ministry (I doubt the pun works in Arabic)&#8212;her love for him is more important.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Cut to&nbsp;them leaving their wedding ceremony and within minutes having a
new, loud argument as he tells her she won&#8217;t work and she, insisting she will,
reminds him that he promised she could.&nbsp;<span style="">
</span>The end.</p>

<p class="stblpara">Like all fiction, part of the film's subtext is
propaganda. The movie normalizes and implicitly praises
the&nbsp;Egyptian government (Mubarak&#8217;s photo is in at least
one office but in the background) as filled with educated and dignified
leaders, always
dressed in the nattiest Western suits, who must constantly be protected
from
potential harm by anonymous malcontents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The protagonists are solidly middle class and beautiful: having
lost their fathers in childhood, they continue as adults to live with
their mothers (still down the hall from each other) in comfortable but
not lavish homes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By dint of
beauty, hard work and charismatic personality, they have both moved to the tops
of their professions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their mothers are
stereotypes from every nation&#8217;s depictions of mothers with grown children, a little spacy, a little
overweight, fussing and cooking meals that pleases their children&#8212;but wise in the ways of the world.</p>

<p class="stblpara">Other than a couple of relatively chaste kisses and the
slightly revealing nature of western women&#8217;s clothing, there is no hint of sex
in the film.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither is there any hint
of religion or tension between the religious and the secular&#8212;for example, we
never see our hero performing one of the daily Muslim prayers, and we never see a
mosque or religious figure of any kind.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The stand-ins for terrorists are linked to criminal evil-doing, not Islam
or even an Islamic country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
incidentally, by having a drug lord as the focus of the &#8220;terrorist&#8221; attack, the
film supports a notion that Egypt is on the same international ethics page as all
responsible nations.</p>

<p class="stblpara">By Muslim standards, the film is surely enlightened towards
women and surely would call down the most outraged invectives from the
pious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We see no women, including the
mothers, in anything but western dress and hairstyles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We see many women attending a co-ed university with
our heroine.<span style=""> </span>&nbsp;As a
westerner I wasn&#8217;t sure what to make of her feisty acquiescence to him in the
first half of the film&#8212;whether we were supposed to be happy about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But once she gains the upper hand with him
as her bodyguard, the film is clearly asking us to enjoy the turnabout.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the end, however, our male hero succeeds by
brilliant macho behavior and she, even if she intends to do some other work,
yields her plum position with the government.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their argument <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><big>(à</big> </span>la Hepburn-Tracy) as the film ends of course reminds us that not much has
changed, though we know they will live more or less happily ever after.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the ultimate tone is that when push
comes to shove, a physically threatened (and cowering) woman needs a man&#8217;s
protection (that other kidnapped ministers are men is beside the point here),
and the man&#8217;s need should dominate, however slightly.</p>





<p class="stblpara">Subtly, the film also seems to tell the viewer that you can
(and maybe should) be an independent woman (relatively speaking, at least) only
if you are in our heroine&#8217;s class and with her values.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We get no hint that independence is possible
or even desirable for women who dress in religious garb or are uneducated&#8212;it is
as if such women don&#8217;t even exist in this society.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Westernization is the paramount goal.</p>

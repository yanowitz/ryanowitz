<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><i>This
commentary is a slightly edited

was
working intermittently as a volunteer at PS138 in Brooklyn </i><i>with Ms. Dworkin </i><i>who, along with the principal, Mr. Louis (who requested I write this), was extremely

experience as a teacher as well as specific <a href="theaterdramateachingbckgr.html">experience teaching acting</a>, though not in some time:&nbsp;
I had taught improvisational drama to teenagers in
and around
London, to convicts at San Quentin prison, an acting class at a London
theater
school, and a scene study class at Brandeis University.&nbsp;
In England for Hertfordshire County teachers
I had conducted a workshop on using drama in the classroom.&nbsp; In academic settings, I
had often used
role-playing as a technique for identifying with alternative frames of
mind and
for illuminating subject material.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.25in;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Here&#8217;s what I wrote in

<p class="MsoNormal"><b style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">BACKGROUND<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Let me be clear what Ms.
Dworkin&#8217;s drama program at PS 138
is not: it is not a class to make children become actors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I&#8217;d be delighted if any
of the children go
on to explore theater seriously as actors, technical people, writers,
directors--or audience--but these are not the immediate goals.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Ms. Dworkin&#8217;s
[separate] statement
indicates, and as my comments here reinforce, drama at this level
offers a
creative, fun context for learning a wide range of intellectual and
social
skills.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many of the
basic principles
actors must learn are variants on basic principles of being a
constructive member
of society (trust, responsibility, self-discipline, taking turns, being
supportive, cooperating, succeeding by working together, attentiveness,
observation) and of feeling personally competent and fulfilled
(risk-taking,
spontaneity, improvisation, experimentation, intuition, practice,
concentration,
stress on process at least as much as results).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If personal testimony means
anything, I can point out that
as a child, although very bright, I was socially uncomfortable,
unpopular,
introverted and timid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s
hard to say
what is cause and what is effect, but the skills I&#8217;ve accumulated as an
actor
clearly interplay with the rest of my life in giving me poise,
assertiveness,
extemporaneity, and improvisational and intuitive responses to events
in my
life.</p>
<p class="tablhdr" style=""><span style=""><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">REVIEW
OF MY PARTICIPATION AT PS 138</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I began at PS 138 as a Screen
Actors Guild volunteer for a
SAG program that sends actors to read to public school children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Through the PS 138
librarian, Ms. Diaz, I
read to several classes, and they seemed happy with the results.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I involved the children in
the stories:
asked questions about what they thought might happen next, had them act
out
roles in the stories, and had them recap what had happened so far in a
given
story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I often
dramatized scenes I was
describing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I found
that writers like
Poe, whom we might expect still to appeal to children, did not work
well, but a
variety of more contemporary stories (including Dr. Seuss and
especially scary
stories) did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Involving
the children in
choosing the story usually produced good results, but it sometimes
required
several minutes to organize.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Within a few weeks of my start
at PS 138, Ms. Diaz
introduced me to Ms. Dworkin, and with the exception of one week when
Ms.
Dworkin was absent and I read to her classes, I worked with her drama
program.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have
witnessed only a
fraction of what she has actually accomplished on her own, but it is
clear that
she is dedicated and committed to bringing the world of drama to her
pupils.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite
difficult circumstances
(too many pupils in a class, discipline problems, children often not
accustomed
to voluntary self-control, severe limitation on available materials, a
classroom that is sometimes not properly heated), she carries forward
valiantly
and creatively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
shows strong willingness
to experiment and take risks in giving the children a chance to express
themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of the
activities she
describes, I have seen her show videos, involve classes in discussion
of the
films&#8217; contents, have the children act out moments in the films; have
the
pupils improvise both abstractly (e.g., passing around an imaginary
ball that
changes size) and concretely (e.g., walking through different heights
of snow),
and emphasize vocabulary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
have also
seen some of the results of scriptwriting and of children directing
rehearsal
of what they have written.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I have been impressed with the
responsiveness of the
children to what Ms. Dworkin does and to what I have brought to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, I&#8217;ll discuss some
of the difficulties
and complexities that I notice in this setting, but let me start by
underscoring
how impressed I am with what the children do.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Nearly all the children are
enthusiastic, eager to volunteer
and participate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
chance to
role-play, to try out different personae, and to express their own
feelings in
the relatively safe setting of fictional presentation seems to liberate
many of
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Among other
things, the
role-playing includes behaving in ways that in their normal lives merit
reproof
but on &#8220;stage&#8221; can be creative outlets that receive approval.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have been especially
struck by how
children who initially appear shy and quiet can, with very little
encouragement, allow themselves to get involved in playacting before
their
peers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ms. Dworkin&#8217;s account of the
program lists many of the
general benefits that drama can provide our children.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Let me stress those that mean most to me: working
together
(collaborating, cooperating, trusting); observing/paying attention
(noticing
what is happening, listening to fellow actors and to the
director/leader,
remembering what an experience or place was like in order to reproduce
it for
an audience); sharing (space, attention, words, even feelings);
discipline and
self-control (or personally experiencing the consequences when
self-control
breaks down); using the imagination (and being rewarded for it); taking
constructive risks; and learning from watching others (probably the
benefit
that occurs least).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At this developmental level and
with class sizes as they
are, the drama experiences are most successful when they involve the
most
pupils.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Doing a
single exercise in
which many children can take part, or in which many small groups can
function
side-by-side, has been important for keeping the children engaged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mirrors exercise<a style="" href="theaterschoolsdworkin.html#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[1]</span></span></a>
summarized by Ms. Dworkin was particularly striking.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My own assumption, before trying it, was that this
exercise was
only appropriate for older (and relatively disciplined) teenagers and
adults.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it
worked well even with
first graders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some
children could not
get past the giggle and discomfort stage (a common stage for all new
actors of
any age), but they were few.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Nearly all the children, after
varying amounts of
adjustment, took the mirrors exercise seriously and made something
interesting
of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
responded well to
encouragement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(My
disposition is not
to scold children when they are not succeeding, but also not to pretend
they
are succeeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
a tone of
collaboration--that we&#8217;re in this together and that I know they want to
be
effective with the exercise--I point out where they need to focus their
attention, and most of them respond well to this.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then, when I can genuinely praise them for what they
have
achieved, they seem just as genuinely pleased with themselves.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be interesting to
figure out
reasons for the unexpected success of this difficult and
concentration-demanding exercise, and to think about ways that
equivalent
effects could be encouraged in other areas of education.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some of the theatrical and
social purposes
here are identical: intense concentration on the task at hand, with an
ability to
shut the mind off to outside distractions (with the more successful
pairs, I
will deliberately try to distract them, e.g., by walking between them
or making
funny faces at them); to work with a partner and help, not trick, that
partner
(it takes many children a long time to understand this); to have your
own
success inseparable from your partner&#8217;s (the exercise is most
successful when
an onlooker cannot tell who is leading and who is following).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As partners develop
confidence and a sense
of cooperation, they can also undertake more and more interesting and
complex
movements.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Pretty much any role-playing
exercise that touches students&#8217;
own experience can work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We&#8217;ve
had them
jumping rope (without a rope: those at either end of the rope must work
together to seem to be turning the same rope; the jumper must try to
find the
rhythm established by the turners), riding a subway car together
(moving in
sync with the movements of the car), carrying imaginary buckets of
water (they
must show the weight, and show how the weight changes as the leader
calls out
changes to them), taking a common object like a book bag or block of
wood and
improvising other objects (the bag might be a hair dryer or an apron;
the wood
might be a pillow or a typewriter; they must free associate--and they
must take
turns).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">With one class I did a simple
group exercise: go into a
movie theater and watch the movie.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This
turned out to involve considerable brainstorming and sequential
thinking: what
can happen when you get to the theater (e.g. there might be a long
line) and at
each stage of getting in?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Who
works
there?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What must
happen for you to see
the movie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(It took
a long time for the
children to remember that the lights get dimmed, or that someone must
work a
projector.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I have used a trust exercise
which works but can&#8217;t involve
enough children at one time (so that the watchers can grow restless): 4
children link arms, and a 5th falls into the arms.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The leader must be rigorous, test the linked arms,
tune into
whether the catchers are taking the exercise seriously, and not let the
exercise proceed if it will not work.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(If the participants do not seem serious enough, it
is important not to
&#8220;blame&#8221; them but just to let them know that they need more work and
attention
to the exercise before they will be ready to finish it.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But most of these children
showed they were
up to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
hardest task is for the
faller, who has the instinct to put out her or his arms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The falling is first face
forward, then
backward (we didn&#8217;t get to the backward part).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The children should learn the importance of trusting
one another, and of
building that trust by being trustworthy, responsible.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(I can think of no more fundamental principle
of good acting than being reliable and trusting your fellow actors to
be so,
too.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I plan to try other exercises,
such as building a machine
together (each one adds a rhythmic part to what others are doing; you
can have
them add sounds; the machine can speed up and slow down) and
communicating with
gibberish or counting or reciting the alphabet (the activity and tone
of voice
should make obvious what the words mean).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The children seem to enjoy
having a &#8220;real&#8221; actor work with
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While they
have little patience
for long explanations of exercises or their benefits (they want to get
down to
the work--or play--itself), they always seem interested in asking me
questions
about acting and discussing what it&#8217;s like to be in the theater or on a
movie
set.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their
questions, even at a very
early age, are often quite thoughtful.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On the spur of the moment, I
once performed a couple of
audition monologues, intended for adults, and the children were quite
absorbed
with the material.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">All that I&#8217;ve been saying
points to a principle that has
often been established in other contexts: People--including kids, and
including
kids we&#8217;ve been taught to think of as deprived and
underprivileged--will, if
given the chance, show unexpected depth, creativity and potential.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="page-break-after: avoid;"><b style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">DRAMA
WORK AREA<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Although kids can adapt to the
most constraining spaces,
it&#8217;s best to have a large open area that can serve as a stage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s possible to set up
some simple lighting
(photographers&#8217; clamp lights can be used; and you can even set up
reflectors
with shaped aluminum foil), and this adds the theater &#8220;task&#8221; of
operating the
lights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
personally don&#8217;t think a
curtain is important to theater, but it would be easy enough to rig a
wire
above the front of the stage area and, perhaps with shower curtain
rings or the
equivalent, hook up old blankets or other large pieces of material.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A place to gather and store
props would be good.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
would like to encourage pupils to bring in
old clothes, toys, household objects, and the like.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(I&#8217;d set rules: you can&#8217;t buy anything; you must
have permission
from the owner.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
collection of
objects should have no intrinsic value; if they disappear, the only
loss should
be emotional, not financial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
children should come to feel a proprietary interest in the common
properties,
and a sense of sharing them with other classes now in the school and
attending
the school in future years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
the
teacher(s) should not have to worry about keeping a close eye on the
materials.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The props and costumes can
provide a huge store of
improvisational possibilities, ranging from creating a character on the
spur of
the moment to affecting different personae to developing a set and
collection
of characters that can tell a whole story.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They also intensify the children&#8217;s sense that this
really is a drama
setting, and that they're really doing theater.</p>
<p class="tablhdr" style=""><span style=""><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">SOME
OF THE DIFFICULTIES</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I expect that the difficulties
I&#8217;ve observed and encountered
will not be surprising.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
they surely
stem in part from the familiar limitations of a setting like PS 138:
little
money, large classes, exhausted and harried teachers (sometimes with
competing
agendas), kids who often have difficulty at self-control, a physically
deteriorated building, minimal physical materials for stimulating the
imagination.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Of course there are many
disciplinary problems.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes
but not always, these can be channeled
into constructive classroom energy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The
exercise of carrying buckets of water can lead to throwing the
imaginary water
at classmates--or, more often, at me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Eating together in a lunchroom can prompt a mimed
food fight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly,
anti-social behavior that normally
invites punishment not only avoids penalty but actually gets praise.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Those adults fearful of
released inhibitions will no doubt
argue that I&#8217;m only encouraging the same behavior in normal life, but
the truth
is quite the reverse: the children <i style="">know</i>
they are acting (instead of acting out), they <i style="">know
</i>that what they are doing is in a safe classroom
setting, and
part of their pleasure and energy comes from having no illusions that
they are
mimicking socially unacceptable behavior.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sometimes, no matter what you
do, some children will disrupt
the class.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have
seen the occasional
fight, children ignoring the lesson and hiding behind chairs at the
rear of the
room, squabbles over who owns what pen or notebook, and so on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some of this means the
&#8220;lesson&#8221; is not as
compelling as it could be, but some of it just goes with the territory.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Indeed, a key paradox of the
kind of drama Ms. Dworkin
encourages is that it heightens the discipline problem.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The children are implicitly encouraged to
vent their energy, to make noise; it is hard for anyone, especially
young
children, and especially young children from backgrounds with a sharp
dichotomy
between good and bad behavior (good=quiet, restrained; bad merits
repression),
to maintain self-control.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes
the
leader must corral the energy, but sometimes it tempers itself and
contributes
towards that goal we all want to encourage: an internal control from
one&#8217;s own
sense of self rather than an external one imposed by other people.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The mall exercise was the
riskiest this way, and I was
primed for it to get out of control and have to cut it short; and
indeed, there
came a point where this seemed about to happen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But in a way I don&#8217;t understand, the &#8220;chaos&#8221; peaked,
and the
exercise continued, not with total control but with tolerable disorder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the midst of about 10
different
activities, with all the high stimulation, a number of students did
very
creative things: one group sized sneaker customers, one child
telephoned an
order to the pizzeria, a store promoted a variety of toys.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This point can create a
different practical problem: even
with a closed door, the noise from an active drama class may reach to
others
parts of the school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some
teachers
don&#8217;t trust the importance of drama anyway, and many people would look
at it as
an arty self-indulgence when we seem not to have enough money even for
the
core, traditional, &#8220;academic&#8221; subjects.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Some teachers and parents, I expect, would fear
encouraging students to
vent and express themselves as they must in drama. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>(These
are more guesses and responses to rumor; I have to say that
personally at PS 138 I have experienced only support and thanks for my
part in
the drama activities.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The size of the class is a
major brake on effective drama at
this level.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
ideal size would be
10-12, I suspect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>25
or so, especially
with embedded discipline problems and the difficulty the pupils
experience in
staying focused and in control, severely undermines the range of
activities one
can manage in a drama program, especially at this level.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One evidence of the pupils&#8217;
engagement with the classes is
the paradox of how poorly they often answer questions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(I am curious how much the following
phenomenon exists in regular classes, too.)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I pose a question, I usually see a very large
number of hands in
the air.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But two
curious and
frustrating responses are common: (1) when called on, the child has no
idea
what answer to give (and rarely is there an intrinsically &#8220;right&#8221;
answer) and
(2) the child gives an answer that has nothing to do with the question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I suspect part of the
problem here--and I
gather this at least is a problem across the curriculum--is that such a
child
listens to only a word or two of the question and then fills the rest
in with
his or her own question that has a known and personal answer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Whatever other reasons explain
these responses, I believe
that one key explanation is the children&#8217;s desire to participate and be
noticed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I try not
to be punitive: to
a child who has no answer I might say, &#8220;Think about it some more and
raise your
hand again if you have another idea&#8221;; to the child who gives an
irrelevant
answer, I&#8217;ll first try to figure out the connection between what I
asked and
what the child said: if I can, I&#8217;ll point that out and then recall the
actual
question, and if I can&#8217;t figure it out, I&#8217;ll say something like,
&#8220;that&#8217;s an
interesting point but the question was...&#8221; and then repeat the question
and
call on someone else.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
get the
impression that an irrelevant answer doesn&#8217;t perturb the child, but
that having
no answer is embarrassing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
any
event, I believe that the general demeanor of the teacher in face of
such
responses from the children should be to appreciate the desire to
participate
but to be gently clear that the response was not appropriate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Touching a child briefly<a style="" href="theaterschoolsdworkin.html#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[2]</span></span></a>
can often convey a feeling of caring that mitigates the experience of
criticism
even in gentle words.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I&#8217;ve noticed that sometimes the
brightest pupils are the
most uncontrolled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
would hope that
drama is at least a small way of helping such children channel their
energies,
but it is hard not to give a disproportionate amount of attention to
misbehaving children, which of course reinforces their disruptive
behavior.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also
concerns me that
these bright but disruptive children are exactly the ones who will
suffer
most--and probably cause most social harm later in life--from inability
to
focus their talent and from the besieged teacher&#8217;s need to deal with
other
children at the same time.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The problem is compounded for
such bright children during
question-and-answer exchanges: they can easily hold the limelight
because they
are able to come up with good answers and because other children (not
necessarily less bright but certainly thinking of themselves as less
bright)
defer to them and reinforce the one-sidedness of the discussion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed the other children
may feel
intimidated not only intellectually but also physically.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="page-break-after: avoid;"><b style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">NOTES
ON THE SOCIAL CONTEXT OF TEACHING DRAMA AT PS 138<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As an outsider and a relative
newcomer to NY (I was born in
the Bronx but left when I was 4, intermittently visited NY over the
years since
then, and at the start of 1994 came here to live and see if I could
develop an
acting career), I am most struck by the <i style="">de
facto</i> segregation at PS 138.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Having
worked in the civil rights movement, including a stint as a teacher in
Mississippi Freedom Summer, I am especially dismayed by what strikes me
as
mainstream American society&#8217;s dereliction towards our most victimized
communities--victimization which our society nurtures, sometimes
actively,
often passively, and then turns around and condemns when it impinges on
their
own lives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
different communities
around the country, different groups of people are the victims; in PS
138, it seems
to be largely the children of what we label as minority groups.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I mistrust such labels:
however well
intended, they tend to make both the labeled and the labelers see the
group as
deviant from a norm and sometimes even as damaged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Early on as a single parent, for example, I realized
that my son
and I had to view our family as a norm and not a &#8220;broken home,&#8221; as the
common
sociological parlance had it 20 years ago.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I wonder at the effect of
having two white teachers of
European extraction for students who are almost exclusively non-white,
non-European
in background, or both.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
the
children, though often showing constructive sensitivity and pride
(sometimes
curiosity) about their ethnic and racial backgrounds, seem concerned
only with
whether they are enjoying themselves.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I
believe in multiculturalism, and I would not want to find myself
irrelevant to
them any more than I want to find them irrelevant to me.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Theatricality, of course, is
intrinsically
multicultural.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a
wide variety of
forms (including story-telling, oral history, public recitation, music
and
dance--separately and together in all their local and international
permutations,--oratory, rites of passage, role-reversal, religious
ceremony,
puppetry, miming, mock hunts, juggling, strolling minstrels, traveling
theater
troupes), it is universal and basic to human culture across time and
geography,
in part because it reinforces cultural values, in part because it
creates a
sense of community, in part because it simultaneously develops the
individual&#8217;s
separateness and connectedness with society, and in part because it&#8217;s
just
fun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is no
accident that in all
cultures, much child&#8217;s play involves theatricality: playing house,
trick-or-treating, dressing up in parents&#8217; clothes, playing with dolls,
acting
out various social roles and professions, war games, hunting games, and
so on.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I suspect that all our behavior
is ultimately imitation of
others: at first, the imitation is self-conscious, awkward and
obvious--not at
all a part of us, merely a grafting on of someone else&#8217;s behavior--but
over
time it becomes natural, becomes part of who we ourselves are.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The human being in this
sense is like a
great actor who portrays a shimmering collocation of behaviors that
blend into
a single, unique personality that convinces others of its authenticity.</p>

COUPLE OF USEFUL BOOKS</span></b></p><p class="MsoNormal"><b style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;"></span></b>Viola Spolin&#8217;s <i style="">Improvisation
for the Theater</i> is a classic that has many wonderful
exercises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
devotes a short chapter to working with
young children, but many of her exercises elsewhere in the book can be
adapted
to such children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
book is published
by Northwestern University Press, apparently last revised in 1999 (I
have the
1963 edition), and can be found at web stores like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Improvisation-Theater-Directing-Techniques-Performance/dp/081014008X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1200424554&amp;sr=8-1">Amazon</a>

<p class="MsoNormal">John Holt&#8217;s <i style="">How
Children Fail</i>, first published in 1964,<i style="">
</i>remains a terrific text for thinking about how
ostensibly
difficult children really have very bright strategies to circumvent
pedagogical
intent. &nbsp;The latest edition appears to be 1980 by Dell
Publishing. &nbsp;This book, too, you can find at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Children-Fail-John-Holt/dp/0440338697/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1200425413&amp;sr=1-2">Amazon</a>

with feet together, hands at

start moving and B
to mirror exactly what A does.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
some coaching to overcome universal mistakes (A: move slowly, help your

</span>After awhile, I will call out that B should lead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Initially, this adjustment
is always
difficult.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as I
go back and forth
between A and B as leaders, shortening the time before the shift, most
partners
perform quite decently.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eventually,
maybe the first time, maybe a later day, I call out, &#8220;Nobody is

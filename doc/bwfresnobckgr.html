far, I have found no documentary material about my year at Fresno
State, so what I write here is from memory only. &nbsp;(And&nbsp;I'm only writing enough background to help make sense of the
Fresno connection to the Borehamwood saga.)</p><p>After my 1964 <a href="autocycleeurope.html">trip to Europe</a>,
I
lazed around my parents' home in Highland Park, NJ, for several weeks.
&nbsp;During this time I received a phone call from the Fresno State
College (now Fresno State University) English department offering me a
full-time job teaching freshman and sophomore English. &nbsp;In those
days, there was actually a shortage of college teachers, and I suppose
the department had a last-minute opening. &nbsp;They consulted the
placement office at Claremont Graduate School, looked at my file, and
hired me.</p><p>Aside from teaching, I became involved in a Fresno Friends of <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/sncc/">SNCC</a>
chapter (I may well have helped create it) that was not all white but
may well have been mostly white. &nbsp;Aside from anything else we did,
we became involved in attacking <span style="font-style: italic;">de facto</span> segregation in the Fresno schools.
&nbsp;If I remember correctly, the bulk of black people lived literally
on the other side of the tracks from the rest of town. &nbsp;</p><p>We
began drawing up position papers and attending meetings of the Board of
Education. &nbsp;Eventually we drew up our own proposal for busing
students within the city. &nbsp;I don't know if we decided this on our
own or responded to a challenge from the Board; if the latter, it was
probably assumed we would now go away. &nbsp;News of our activity
became well known around town, to the dismay of most white people, and
perhaps with little support from the black community. &nbsp;A couple of us appeared on local television.</p><p>I
was the one to present our plan to the Board of Ed. &nbsp;Normally,
attendance would be small, perhaps as much as a couple of dozen for the
right issue. &nbsp;At this meeting the auditorium was full, 800 people
as I recall, and I don't remember if any of them were not white.
&nbsp;They certainly didn't seem friendly. &nbsp;We had made some maps to illustrate our plan, and at some
point&nbsp;I gestured from one end of town to the other to illustrate
one particular busing route. &nbsp;I still remember the collective gasp
of horror from the audience.</p><p>I'm sure we were thanked and sent on our way.
&nbsp;Before or after that we made controversial visits at least to the
high school and maybe other teaching groups where we discussed what we
were up to. &nbsp;Even those meetings were highly controversial.</p><p>In
tandem with this activity was my sponsorship of some student political
group which one day held a rally in a campus free-speech area. (Remember
that this was after the Free Speech Movement at Berkeley, and
authorities at campuses around the country had been trying to ward off
any similar student uprising.) &nbsp;I was one of those to speak, and I
gave a talk on non-violent civil disobedience. &nbsp;This got picked
up--I think by the local newspaper, the Fresno <span style="font-style: italic;">Bee</span>--that I had advised students to break laws.</p>Here
is a quaint clipping (and the artful envelope that encosed it) I
received in February, 1966, from one of Fresno's finer seniors
who,&nbsp;having&nbsp;underlined key passages for later reference,
shows his mastery of good reading habits. &nbsp;He did, alas, fail to
provide the full text that would have shown me exactly how I caused the
death of a soldier, presumably in Vietnam. &nbsp;(Rafferty has to
be&nbsp; Max Rafferty, head of the California state department of
education who kept getting re-elected to office despite
outrageous&nbsp;exteme right wing statements he was well known for.)<p><img style="width: 300px; height: 700px;" alt="" src="fresno/1966%20feb19%20fresno%20nasty%20note%20fr%20FSC%20senior.jpg"> &nbsp;<img style="width: 500px; height: 279px;" alt="" src="fresno/1966%20feb19%20fresno%20envelope%20for%20nasty%20note%20fr%20FSC%20senior.jpg"></p>In
March of '66 the Fresno City College paper (not Fresno State College)
reported on the value and legitimacy of protest. &nbsp;I remember Frank
Verges well, another young faculty member in the philosophy department
who I think also showed up in Berkeley went I went there after Fresno.
&nbsp;Frank was quieter, sexier and hipper than I.<br><img style="width: 800px; height: 792px;" alt="" src="fresno/fresno%20state%20newspaper%20mar%2010%201966%20copy2.jpg"><img style="width: 800px; height: 386px;" alt="" src="fresno/fresno%20state%20newspaper%20mar%2010%201966%20copy1.jpg"><br><p>In
the spirit of no good deed goes unpunished (in this case my political
activism in Fresno), three years after I left, while first teaching in
London, a reference letter was solicited from Fresno and haunted me
for well over a year.&nbsp; I reproduce&nbsp;it here and follow it with a
lengthy critique I composed 15 months after the letter arrived at Tulse
Hill. &nbsp;</p><p>So first, the "reference" letter (I assume "exorcised" in item 3 is a typo by the Fresno State
Academic Vice President...):<a name="bw_fresno_ref"></a></p><img style="width: 800px; height: 1481px;" alt="" src="borehamwood%20jpegs%20compressed/fresno%20refs%20to%20ILEA_Page_1.jpg"><br><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: auto;"><img style="width: 800px; height: 637px;" alt="" src="borehamwood%20jpegs%20compressed/fresno%20refs%20to%20ILEA_Page_2.jpg"><p>Next, here is my 3-page commentary, presumably
written in the summer of 1970, perhaps to a non-Fresno California ACLU
chapter.&nbsp;(It is a curious irony&nbsp; that the head of the Fresno
Board of Education when Friends of SNCC was dealing with it was also
head of the Fresno ACLU and a faculty member--sociology, I think--at
Fresno State...)<a name="bw_my_letter_on_fresno_ref"></a></p><img style="width: 800px; height: 1014px;" alt="" src="borehamwood%20jpegs%20compressed/bw%20%20my%20comment%20on%20fresno%20ref_Page_1.jpg"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"></span><img style="width: 800px; height: 1082px;" alt="" src="borehamwood%20jpegs%20compressed/bw%20%20my%20comment%20on%20fresno%20ref_Page_2.jpg"><br><img style="width: 800px; height: 876px;" alt="" src="borehamwood%20jpegs%20compressed/bw%20%20my%20comment%20on%20fresno%20ref_Page_3.jpg"><br><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: auto;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Previous</span>: <a href="bwhomepage.html">Introduction</a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Next</span>:&nbsp;<a href="bwfresnotolondon.html">Fresno to London</a><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><big></big> </span></td></tr></tbody></table><a href="bwtemplate.html#topofpage"></a><a href="bwfresnobckgr.html#topofpage">Top of page</a><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Back to&nbsp;</span><big style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><small>&nbsp;</small></big><a href="Otherautobiography.html">Other personal autobiography</a> <big style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><small>page</small></big><br><a href="index.html"><b>HOME PAGE</b></a></body></html>

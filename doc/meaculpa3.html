<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
mother's mother was Gitel Greenberg.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She and six of my mother's brothers and sisters lived in Allentown,
Pennsylvania.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think the last time I
saw her I was about twelve.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
small and always loving and seemed very, very old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She walked slowly and spoke slowly, trying to answer my questions
so that I would understand her Yiddish.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Willie,
who was frowned upon by the family because he married a shiksa, had an antique
business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had lived with Baba before
his marriage and her house, though not cluttered, had its share of
antiques.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were a number of
grandfather's clocks, a huge print of Noah's Ark with all the animals walking
up a long gangplank, two by two, another print of an eye staring through a pyramid&#8211;I
guess it was my first museum.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
don't remember ever meeting my Zayda.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He may have died in Europe though I have a warm feeling about him.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
mother's oldest brother was Morris, who owned a feed mill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was the rich brother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His wife was Fanny, who acted like an
aristocrat and whose smile I mistrusted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They had two sons, Oscar and Benny.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Benny committed suicide when he was twenty-two.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
think Sam was married to another Fanny.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Julius was married to Sadie and she was probably the friendliest of my
Allentown relatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then there was Jake,
whose wife I don't remember even though I was occasionally accepted into their
home for a few days.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
mother's sister Sadie was married to a hulk of a man whose name was Max
Sherman, and they had at least three children.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ida, who was about Hy's age; Daniel, about mine; and Schmuelke, about
Irving's age, I guess.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stayed in
their house once and, though I have no recollection now, nor had any at the
time, I was accused of beating up Schmuelke.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I didn't get invited again.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">All
of the Allentownians lived comfortable lives for as long as I knew them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My Aunt Helen, the educated one in the
family, married Julius Nemetz, a chemist, and they lived in Rockford,
Illinois.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had one child, a boy,
who was drafted into the army, went through basic training, was sent overseas,
and was killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Uncle Julius eventually
made the hellish adjustment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aunt Helen
never could.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She grieved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her son's death put a period to her life.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Fortunately,
an early attachment Aunt Helen formed for my sister Mink helped stabilize
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She wanted Mink to come and live
with her and Julius.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Though that didn't
pan out, the three of them benefited from the warm relationship.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Uncle
Julius was always interesting to talk with and he was always ready with
advice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He gave Leo and Mink his sixty
or sixty-five or I-don't-know-what-year De Soto.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
favorite uncle, Joe, struggled to make a living in Brooklyn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He, as well as all my uncles and aunts, had
several children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Uncle Joe was an
inventor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of his inventions almost
took hold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a bedspring that
could be tilted up by stepping on a pedal so that the housewife could clean it
and the floor under it with ease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
had a patent on that, at least.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Mom's
youngest sister was Bertha, the sewing machine girl.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While working in a factory she punctured a finger with a needle,
developed a blood disease and lived with us until the infection killed
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She became too infirm to work and
my mother took her into our family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
must have been no older than thirty when she died.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Aunt
Bertha was always ailing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her skin was
unattractive and she used to make up some mucillaginous mess and sleep with her
face covered with it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would peel off
in the morning like a heavy wax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
guess it was supposed to have a depilatory effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was never very friendly with me, because I was a devil with
the kids.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was particularly fond of
Mink.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My sister was particularly
scrawny when she was very young; a poor eater; a bit sickly; had had St. Vitus
Dance at one time and her frailty touched Aunt Bertha who sought to shield her
from the hell that she had experienced.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
aunt may not have been very sprightly, but she was instrumental in saving all
of our lives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time, we lived on
the ground floor of 71 East Fourth Street.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was an airshaft that was used by tenants to hang
clotheslines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our kitchen window was
angled against the kitchen window of the ground floor of the apartment of the
house next door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The apartment in the
rear had the same arrangement.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
were a family of eight and slept in two beds.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was my habit to sleep with my head under the covers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cover was a pehrena&#8211;a thick, down
quilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was midwinter and I slept
blissfully, but was awakened by a scream-shout from my mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Coming up from under the quilt I discovered
her and my mother scrambling on the floor and my brother stumbling towards the
living room windows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I jumped out of
bed and helped him open the windows, letting the freezing air in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He opened the front door and shouted and
soon the apartment was swarming with half-dressed neighbors and very quickly
police and emergency truck men who held a cone over the noses of each member of
my family, and though I obviously didn't need it, the man in charge looked at
me and decided to make my day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He held
the respirator over my nose and told me to breathe deeply.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
mother was up, my aunt was up, the kids were up, Hy was up, and I was up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Coal gas from the faulty furnace had almost
wiped us out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seems Aunt Bertha had
to go to the bathroom, had gotten out of bed, become dizzy, and had fallen
down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The noise awakened my mother, who
went to her assistance, also became dizzy, and had also fallen down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had shouted and Hy had gotten up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She shouted for him to open the front room
windows and I had awakened to help him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>We felt heroic and immensely
happy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was quite theatrical.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our pictures were in the center section of
The Daily News.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was a celebrity in
school...for a day.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
man who lived in the apartment fronting ours was found to have died of carbon
monoxide poisoning.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0.5in;" align="center">*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Hy
liked to recite poetry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He loved Robert
W. Service and Kipling and, copycat that I was, I too started reciting
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Gunga Din,"
"Fleurette," "The Face on the Barroom Floor," many, many
more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those were his apolitical
years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later on he started to recite
excerpts of a more revolutionary nature from soapboxes at Stuyvesant and Union
Squares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never felt smart enough to
confront hecklers or answer questions about the state of the world.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
was very good at recitations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
always chosen first in class.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
I guess my sins caught up with me in about the fourth grade.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was given a recitation to memorize by my
teacher.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proudly I took it home and
studied it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house was in a bit of a
shambles as we had just moved in our downward spiral.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Barrels of dishes, pots and pans, food, bedding and farshideneh
chazerai cluttered the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I put
my speech down and that was the last I saw of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I should have; of course I should have;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I should have told my teacher, but I was ashamed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wanted to find it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The days flew by.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't find it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
teacher asked me once in a while how it was coming.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had the opportunity to confess, but by now I was frightened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally push came to shove. . .she wanted to
hear it.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
know it's not possible to remember a facial expression for close to sixty
years, but I have such a sense of staring at the archetype of the betrayed
one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were pain, dismay, and
thwarted mayhem on my teacher's face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
didn't get to make the speech.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">In
fifth grade I received, from another teacher, two awards, a praise card for
Enunciation and another for Cheerfulness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don't think I was that calculating, but every time my teacher looked
at me I was smiling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As for
enunciation, Ahvahdeh.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0.5in;" align="center">*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
sister, Sylvia was (is?) an epileptic.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The story was that at the age of two she had<span style="">&nbsp; </span>been frightened by a mad dog.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was a very bright kid, but the seizures affected her brain through
the years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was never stupid, but
any of her days or nights could be blighted by a spell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctors said that some damage was
caused&#8211;I think tiny hemorrhages occurred and a subtle change was taking
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The spell would come upon her
suddenly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first awareness of it was
an eerie low-pitched moan that grew in volume as her body would thrash about,
her muscles become tight, her jaws clamp, her eyes bulge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the moan would grow to an ever-louder
groan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She could not be restrained; and
when it appeared as though her arms would break from the strain, there would be
a lessening in the quivering rigidity, her eyes would flutter, she'd breathe
heavily and slowly relax.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">In
the throes of the attack, we had been given to fear that she might bite off a
piece of her tongue, so we'd force a wooden object between her jaws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Medical literature today says it's not
necessary.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Her
spells frightened her classmates and her teachers, so she couldn't attend
school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would take her to a movie
sometimes when she hadn't had a spell for a long time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was being dosed with phenobarbitol and
our hopes were always high that she would "outgrow" this curse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was always an extra problem when we
went to the movies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had to make sure
there were empty seats on either side of us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If not, we'd have to move, to avoid the hands that sought to "feel
us."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Sometimes
we'd sit through the whole show and everything was okey-dokey.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, we might have to move once or
twice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But too often, as I was absorbed
in the movie, the moan would begin and I'd be unaware because of being rapt in
the film.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the sound would grow and
grow and I'd become alerted to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd
have to find some way to prevent her from biting her tongue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once I jammed my finger between her teeth
and almost had it bitten off before I could remove it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd lead her out of the movie house when she
was strong enough to walk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We'd run the
gamut of the disturbed, curious audience, and when we got home she'd go to bed.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
were not a particularly healthy family.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I know that Hy had contracted infantile paralysis as a child, and it had
left him, luckily, only with one shoulder lower than the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This didn't interfere with his athletic
competence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was pretty good at
stickball and softball and I think he even played some hardball.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember watching a game in the Hebrew
yard behind the Hebrew school we attended and hearing his team cheering him on,
"Yonny, go!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Run!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attaboy!" or something like that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never associated with his friends.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
remember coming home from Central Park once and finding an ambulance in front
of 57 East Fourth and watched as they took Millie and Irving and Abie out of
the building on stretchers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were
taken to Bellevue for observation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
the time polio was hitting too many kids their age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They didn't stay long, but it was a scary situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was listed as malnutritious when I went
out for the football team.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also had a
heart murmur&#8211;I was hoping to suffer with it so I could catch up to the rest of the
family, but it was meaningless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I must
have been fifteen.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">It
was Mom, however, who suffered most.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The pressures of raising five children and me grew too great for
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She lost weight, started coughing
a great deal and had to go to Beth Israel Hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had Consumption, a dread disease for which there was no cure
except rest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>T.B.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was whispered, not spoken aloud.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">When
I came to visit her she told me wrathfully about a young intern<span style="">&nbsp; </span>who would come into the ward and call out, a
la Ted Lewis, "Is Everybody Happy?"<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My mother took it a couple of days and then lashed out at him.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"What's
the matter with you?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is everybody
happy!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We're sick people here and we
have pains and we suffer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How can you
be so foolish?" she berated him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He ceased and desisted thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mom eventually improved in the hospital and came home.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
were getting some financial help from the Jewish Social Service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Passover approached, they would send us
to a place that supplied us with a considerable amount of clothing: suits and
shirts and dresses and underwear and socks and shoes and handkerchiefs. . .They
were a blessing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also sent us to a
place that was perhaps a mile away from home for food packages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother took me along to help her carry
the boxes of matzos and matzo farfel and matzo meal and various other Passover
food staples.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They gave us plenty and
we were both piled down when we left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was about twelve and pretty strong, but the packages were bulky and heavy and
home was forever away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother, always
fighting to save pennies, weighed my struggles and stumblings against taxi
fare.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What a giant she was!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On her own she would have continued until
she dropped, but I got my first ride in a taxi: fifteen cents for the first
quarter mile and five cents each additional quarter mile.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">While
her symptoms of T.B. had abated, Mom had to go back to the hospital for a
mastoid operation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's an operation on
a bone in back of the ear ; and when she was brought up from the operating
room, she had a gigantic bandage jutting out from the side of her head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was the great hospital visitor.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I'd usually be there when she came up
etherized and wait till she woke.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How
feeble and pale she was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd hold her
hand and wish her love and finally she'd waken and I'd start breathing again.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
don't know if I missed any visiting hours.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I'd kiss her hello, give her the news, usually stay for the entire
visiting hour and kiss her goodby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hy
visited also, but was always involved in some social or political activity and
couldn't stay long.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">One
time, after just coming out of the ether after another mastoid operation,
Mom<span style="">&nbsp; </span>was very upset.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She held my hands tightly, kneading them as
she pleaded tearfully, "Eddaleh, call Allentown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Something's happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
know something's happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bertha&#8211;find
out about Bertha."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"All
right, Mama.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'll call, I'll call.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm going right away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just calm down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>lt's bad for you."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Aunt
Bertha, who had been feeling poorly, had been taken to Allentown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Uncle Julius Greenberg and his wife Sadie
were taking care of her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think they
had put her in the hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother
couldn't quiet down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A nurse noticed
her and a doctor was called who gave her a sedative.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Who
had money for a phone call?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I walked home from Bellevue on
twenty-sixth street to fourth street, found out where Hy was, listened as he
approached this mystic instrument I had never used.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He only needed a nickel to talk to Aunt Sadie in Allentown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A magic word "Collect."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Aunt
Bertha had died.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Hy
told the doctor, who listened as he tried to break to Mom gently.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was like a gathering storm, almost
silent in her grief, then gathering power until, warding off the doctor's
needle, she promised she'd control herself, but he had to discharge her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She must go to the funeral of her baby sister.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">She
got her way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bulging white mastoid
bandage bobbed as she mourned, she mourned, she screamed, she questioned
God.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cemetery mohel snipped the
boys' ties and the girls' something else's and held his hand out as he offered
prayers to the gray, silent sky.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
the wooden coffin was lowered and the handfuls of earth plopped on its lid, my
mother tried to throw herself into the grave.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">After
the funeral my mother pressed her brothers and sisters for a proper stone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Ahn ubgehackteh beym."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A chopped-down tree to symbolize the death
of a maiden.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Generosity was held in
check in my mother's family, but there was no stopping her when her cause was
just.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't know where that
chopped-down tree is.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't know
where the unmarked pauper's graves are where any of my family was buried.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's probably a worthwhile pilgrimage.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Due
to my mother's chronic illness, and against my mother's will, Sylvia was sent
to Craig Colony, Sonyea, New York, a sanatorium for illnesses such as
hers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We'd send her packages of food
about once a month and I'd write my mother's dictated letters
occasionally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She came home for a visit
once in a while but her condition worsened.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Possibly because of the atmosphere of hopelessness that must exist in
places where people can see mirror images of themselves becoming weaker and
suffering more attacks despite heavy doses of drugs, Sylvia's sense of
hopelessness led her to superstitious hopes for miracles, and eventually she
turned to Christ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It didn't cure her,
but it gave her hope.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Mom
tried to go back to work when she returned from the hospital but the sputum cup
at her bedside showed pink and the doctors told her she had to go to a
tuberculosis sanatorium in the Catskills.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The furniture was put in storage and the family parceled out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hy was seventeen and was accepted at the
Lavenburg Corner House, which was a youth home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The administrators tried to find jobs for the boys who stayed
there,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and meanwhile there was a game
room with a pool table and some card tables with checkerboards in their
centers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a large dining room
and each boy had his own private room.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Sylvia
was in Craig Colony and the kids and I were sent to the Hebrew Orphan
Asylum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We all stayed at The Reception
House, which was a kind of quarantine area.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was fourteen and my first night there, along with about twenty other
children of various ages&#8211;six to fourteen&#8211;and various sexes&#8211;male and female&#8211;was
viewed by a female authority and her female companion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The viewing consisted of uncovering the
lower parts of our anatomies, raising our uniform nightgowns and exposing our
genitals, which were sometimes fingered by the authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since I had been sent to summer camps twice,
it was no novelty to have women look at my privates and tell me to cough, but I
was still embarrassed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One fellow my
age refused to comply and was adamant in his refusal despite being scoffed at
by the female authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Henry Wolfe
became my very good friend.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
kid brothers and sister only spent about a week at The Reception House and then
were transferred to the large building that constituted the orphan asylum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They went to school there, had recreational
facilities, and became absorbed in the community.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Henry Wolfe and I stayed on there and we had a pretty good
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No school, and we played ball and
talked about whatever it is that boys talked about then.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
was pitching a soft ball game one day and a ball came straight at me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I held out my hands and the ball hit the end
of the little finger on my right hand and the top two joints went to the right,
the bottom joint stayed right where it belonged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a dislocated finger and was hurried to the physician at the
Home clinic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He gave it a jerk and it
straightened the finger, though I still have a bulge on the bottom knuckle.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">For
some reason that I can't fathom, another boy and I were chosen to go out on the
town with one of the matrons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
an extremely pleasant person and took us to the Loew's State in the morning to
see a movie and vaudeville.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember
the songs, "I'll Be Glad When You're Dead, You Rascal You, You Devil, You
Dirty Dog," and "Underneath the Harlem Moon," being sung, but I
forget the movie.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Then
we went to Chin Lee's and had a delicious unkosher meal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After that we went to the Rodeo at Madison
Square Garden.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The whole day was a trip
to dreamland.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
was eventually sent to live with a family in Elmhurst, Queens.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were two other boys from the Home
living there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were sixteen year
old<span style="">&nbsp; </span>twins and both were members of the
high school football team, tall, broad, powerful fellows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I shared a room with them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They weren't particularly friendly, and I
used to wonder if a fourteen-year-old could win in a fight with a sixteen-year-old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That's as far as it went&#8211;wondering.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
family consisted of a mother and father and three children; a boy about
twenty-five, another about seventeen and a girl I can't remember, but probably
an adult.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They used to play a great
deal of bridge and I'd watch, and I learned something about the game.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They played Auction and I would be too eager
to make my bid to realize that a bird in the hand was not worth two in the
bush.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You got credit for what you made
even if you bid low and made a grand slam.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It took a long time for that to penetrate.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
remember the seventeen year old son of the family was very supportive and would
praise me and call to the attention of whoever was in the room any good play I
made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mother and daughter were
kind, the father didn't concern himself with me, and the football players
resented having to take "the kid" along when they were practicing.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
was there for about four or five months I guess, and then my mother improved
enough so that she was able to convince the doctors that her health would
suffer if she weren't permitted to be with her children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The homecoming was pretty nice while it
lasted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were interims of my
mother's going back to the hospital when the sputum cup looked suspicious, and
then returning home again and again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
don't think my behavior improved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
are stories about my having a nervous breakdown, but I lay that to the natural
tendencies of story tellers to indulge in exaggeration. (Not me, of course.)</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
think I enjoyed the reputation of being bad.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My mother had her collection of curses she leveled at me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Ah schvartz yore of dir! (You should
have a black year!) Ah chahleryeh zulst du choppin! (A plague on you!)Phar vuss
hut Gutt mir gischtrofft?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Why has God
made me suffer with such as you?) Du bist ahzay vie dyne totten, ah selfisheh
chahleryeh! (You're the same as your completely selfish father!) Ah
meshugenah!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bist duch a
mishugeneh!" (You're crazy!) And other forgotten ones.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">But
if I did get sick, she brimmed, she flowed, she radiated tenderness: "Mein
tahyerer." (My dear one)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"My
sweet one, my poor child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Oy Guttenyu,"
(Oh, Dear God.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Hubrachmunis ahff
der kind!" (Have pity on the child!)</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">And
of course, there would be the conversations, the dreams of a Jewish
Mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Kenst zyne a ducter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No, bist nisht a zeh shane, hust a prusteh
shanekeit, ubber bist nisht mierse."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(You could be a doctor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No,
you're not so good-looking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You have
common good looks, but you're not ugly.)</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
were a cheek-kissing family; no lips.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But we hugged and we shouted and we laughed and some of us cried.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would drive me crazy when the kids
argued, talked too loudly, or laughed too hard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would lash out at them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was a reader, not a scholar, but I didn't want to be disturbed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I really was a selfisheh chahleryeh.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Hy
was the bright one in the family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
trouble was that his effort dropped down.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He quit high school, took a civil service exam for postal clerk and, no
mean feat, got a job as mail carrier.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That was big money in those days.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don't remember how long he kept it.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Things
went sour in fur and I was on the street again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hy and I held on to the room the old-fashioned way:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we stalled.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My father was out on the road again; and even if I could have overcome
my pride enough to ask him for help, he wasn't available.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I couldn't look for any help from
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gotham had no job for me; I was
part of the one-third of a nation "ill-housed, ill-fed, and
ill-clothed."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
finally succumbed to my baser urges.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Beaten down by my protesting hollow center, I went to a place on the Bowery
where free meals were given to hungry people.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There were plenty of us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
long line stretching into the street from the second floor of the building was
made up of all kinds of men&#8211;no women; maybe they had a safer, more respectable
bread line.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were grizzled,
wrinkled drunks; middle-aged, blank-eyed zombies; young men, down to boys my
age and younger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was twenty
then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no smiling, no cracking
of jokes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were bums.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was always a letter in the newspapers
to tell about the "never quit" attitude of successful job-seekers,
intimating that breadliners were beggars looking for handouts and ought to
bestir themselves to regain the dignity of the marketplace.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a pall of what might have been
shame that lay heavily on the queue.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
moved ahead pretty rapidly and I don't think I was on line more than a half
hour before I got two hot dogs, some sauerkraut, a large ladle of mashed
potatoes, a roll, and a mug of white coffee.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I laid my tray on a shelf that ran along the wall and wolfed the food
standing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever else, it was a
nourishing meal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My blood flowed again.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
slept that night in The Mills Hotel, a large building that had been converted
into sleeping quarters for homeless men.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was around Thirty-Fourth Street and each patron had his own little
cubicle the size of a small cell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
walls of the rooms reached to about a foot below the ceiling, providing
ventilation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a community
toilet and washroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I half-slept
through that night and enlisted in the Civilian Conservation Corps the next
day.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">A
lot of young fellows, ages eighteen through twenty-four, were escaping from
their hunger and poverty by joining up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We filled out scads of forms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
didn't know where we'd be sent, but we knew we'd get our food, our clothing,
our medical care, and have a percentage of our pay saved until the end of our
enlistment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some fellows sent their
money home to their families.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
CCC was run by the U.S. Army.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
unemployed youth were becoming a problem; we were at a naturally rebellious
age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petty criminals were becoming
violent and we "good citizens" were beginning to question
goodness:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Where is it getting
us?"</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Some
of us were the disinherited of society, the last-straw clutchers; some were
parolees; some, convicted lawbreakers who had not been sentenced; and some were
adventure seekers, travel lovers....The outfit had some of the aspects of the
Foreign Legion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Enlistees were sent to
Fort Dix, New Jersey, for orientation, medicals, blood tests, and shots.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
were like a pack of pups thrown together, running helter-skelter, sniffing at
the strangeness, making overtures and dashing away, growling and raising
hackles, the timid drawing into corners, the would-be leaders stalking about
aggressively and bulldozing whoever looked like a possible threat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cliques gathered for protection and I found
myself drawn into a small group.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got
into a friendly wrestling match with a fellow about my age, size, and weight,
named Harry Goldschlagg.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had been on
his high school wrestling team.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I held
my own with him.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">After
three days at Dix, we traveled by Pullman for four days and three nights to
Priest River, Idaho.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were put on the
cars alphabetically, so it was just luck if you happened to travel with any of
your three-day friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The atmosphere
was friendlier on the trip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I slept in
the upper and my two seatmates slept in the lower.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of them confessed to me, when we were alone, that he was
Jewish but had hidden the fact because he was afraid of what might happen to
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was smaller than most of the
fellows so I couldn't criticize him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was tall and comparatively strong and didn't even get into shoving matches.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
trip across the country was interesting though occasionally there was too much
of a new thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Newness palled quickly
to my young mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Changing landscapes
became monotonous, towns were towns; however, rivers, streams, ponds, inland
seas kept me, aided by fancy, enthralled.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was the sight of the Rockies in winter that I feasted on:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the twisting climb of the long train in huge
U-turns, where those in the front part of the train could look into the cars of
those at the rear across deep chasms.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The virgin snow, the pines and hemlocks, the bald peaks, the everythings
plucked at the sleeve of my attention and pulled me away from one wonder too
quickly to another wonder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plume
from the engines&#8211;I think there were two&#8211;changed from long feathers to Morse
Code dots and dashes as we climbed slowly but inexorably up to majesty.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
came to a town.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We climbed onto stake-body trucks and stood
swaying for about twenty miles up a narrow mountain road that ran along
unbelievable precipices that dropped off forever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My heart took a pounding until we pulled onto the parade grounds
of Camp 3277, Priest River, Idaho, which was twenty miles from the Canadian
Border and forty miles from Spokane, Washington.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were in a hollow with the mountains towering above us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked around and thought, "My God,
and they're paying me to be here!"</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
lined up facing the flagpole, which stood in the middle of the camp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were addressed by Captain Charles G.
Cassell, a young, regular army officer, who greeted us, wished us well,
introduced us to Top Sergeant Polo, and left.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
Topkick was surrounded by a brace of his underlings, plus the Mess Sergeant,
who was nobody's underling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were
three-stripers and two-stripers and one-stripers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rules were laid down about camp policy:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>lights out, reveille, keeping clean and neat, and what we would
face if we didn't obey orders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
weren't in the army but we were next door to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A dishonorable discharge could mark you for life, so watch your
step.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Polo didn't curse, and he didn't
yell, but he sure sounded like he meant business.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">It
was an old story to the one- to three-year veterans to assign us rookies to our
barracks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was in Barracks Three with
thirty-nine other guys.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a
huge pot-bellied stove in its center.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Our barracks leader made up one cot after warning us to watch carefully,
then he dumped the smile on the face of the guy whose cot he'd used by ripping
off the sheets and blankets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd been
taken in the Hebrew Orphan Asylum by a wise guy who pretended he had two left
thumbs and who had responded to my kindness in making his bed with roaring
guffaws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I took it, but I never
learned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I finished making my cot
pretty quickly and was besieged by requests, demands, and threats that I help a
squadron of quitters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I started to be
obliging to one poor, helpless schmo, but glanced up and caught the wise-guy glint
in his eyes and scrambled what I'd accomplished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He started to puff up, and I turned my back on him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing happened.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
barracks leader inspected our work, tore up some cots and made the guys redo
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He sent a couple guys outside to
bring wood in from the woodbox on the side of the barracks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What they brought in were split hunks of
logs about eighteen inches long.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
showed us, after warning us that some moron was always cutting a finger or a
hand off, how to split the hunks into smaller hunks and how to shave kindling
from them if we needed to start a fire.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then he lined us up and marched us to the supply barracks where we got
our gear:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>navy coats, woolen jerseys,
very stiff pants and jackets that were called tin suits, woolen caps with earlaps,
high leather shoes, woolen socks, o.d. pants and shirts, long johns with trap
doors, dungarees, and sundries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
marched back to the barracks, stowed our gear in the wooden trunks in front of
our cots, and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>were told to wash up for
chow and be ready for mess call in fifteen minutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latrine was plenty crowded for a while; but when chow-call
came, we were ready and hungry.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
had a good meal and were told by Polo that we had free time until taps to
explore the camp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were shown our rec
hall where we could shoot pool, play ping-pong, buy candy, cigarettes and odds
and ends at the commissary, and fool around generally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only thing was that we couldn't shoot
craps there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A lot of us went back to
the barracks and shot craps there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
learned why the house always wins.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Experienced crap-shooters owned the dice and cut something off every
pot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They rarely bet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Craps was the only fun game in town and
everybody was welcome to play.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were
assembled in the cold for retreat, listened to the bugler blow taps, and were
happy to get to bed, except for a few guys who were short-sheeted and had to
remake their cots.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Most
of us were used to giving authority its due, whether parents, teachers, or
cops, so when our barracks leader and his assistant came through the barracks
as Reveille sounded at 5:30 a.m. yelling, "Drop your cocks and grab your
socks!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we hit the deck and
started shrugging into our clothes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Some fellows covered their heads with their pillows and had to be
jounced and bounced by the leaders and their cots overturned if their responses
were less than immediate.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">First
on the agenda were assembly, the raising of the flag, and fifteen minutes of
snappy exercises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The woolen jersey
itched like hell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crisp air was
about twenty above; we wore no jackets, but even before we started our jumping
jacks, we didn't complain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dry
mountain air fooled us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It felt
comfortable if not warm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It gave us an
appetite though.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We ate and started our
first work day for the United States Forestry Service in the Rockies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>White pines were the money trees and it was
our job to make room for them by sawing down the one-hundred foot hemlocks,
trimming and burning them, and planting seedling pines that would grow to be
200 feet tall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were on our way by seven,
climbing the winding precipitous road.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Looking back, we could see the three tracks our truck made, two deep
ones from the tires and a shallower one from the rear end.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After about twenty minutes we stopped,
piled out, were issued double-edged axes, given a demonstration on the uses
thereof, and sent off to start our individual bonfires.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">After
every Christmas on the East Side, the annual illegal burnings of the Christmas
trees were eagerly attended events; the pungent odor of the wood smoke and the
crackling of the pine needles transmuting our dingy streets into forests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>New York's finest frowned on this innocent
pastime, and firemen considered it a sin.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But here in the forest of Idaho we were smelling and listening to an
entertainment we'd never dreamed of, and nobody reproached us for our fun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We trimmed the trees with vigor, strove with
each other to build our pyres higher and higher and so worked faster and
faster; but it all ended in ashes.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Our
tin suits kept us dry as the snow melted all about us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Chopping was a great way to let off steam or
just to take pride in accomplishment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>How many blows would it take, how hard could I strike?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was never grueling, and by the time we
got tired we'd break for lunch.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
truckdriver was the cook for the men in his truck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He didn't exactly cook; he distributed sandwiches and made the
coffee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The coffee was sometimes a
problem&#8211;sometimes delicious and sometimes shitty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a reason for everything and a bit of woods-wisdom was
often the difference. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>We were always
accompanied by a member of the USFS, who was usually born and bred in Idaho and
was always difficult to understand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
hours weren't too long, the food was okay, at least to little old hungry me,
and I gave serious thought to becoming a forest ranger.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
learned a bit of humility when I tried to keep up with some of the
veterans.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They could move more quickly
through the littered forest, chop down trees that would take me ten strokes of
my axe with two strokes of theirs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
could be semi-giants, like Frank Paul, or half-a-head shorter than me, like
Danny O'Connell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never could make up
my mind if it was born into them&#8211;they were both from Idaho&#8211;or if it was
practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd always thought I was
strong, but Danny'd squeeze a beer can into a closed accordion shape with one
hand; I'd tip it slightly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I understood
how Thor had felt when lifting the Midgard Serpent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither Frank nor Danny was aggressive, but nobody, I mean
nobody, ever tried them.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Some
hitches were up and they needed a truckdriver.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I'd indicated I could drive on my application form so they tried me out
and I passed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The USFS man who rode
with me was as taciturn a man as I have ever met.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd converse with him and he'd respond with monosyllabic grunts
that were supposed to mean something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
struggled but made little headway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
didn't speak the same language.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did
learn that a 'cowt' was a coyote, but when he had to give me any kind of
directions, we were both frustrated&#8211;he by my "What's?" and me by his
casual assumption that I understood his most complex explanations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I quit trying when I felt there was too much
dross mixed with the gold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I decided
I'd work out my own destiny, fortified by my superbrainpower.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Now
I drove the precipitous road, my truck made the three tracks, I ground down to
lower and lower gears to gain power or to brake while my stoical seat companion
would occasionally grunt as if in pain.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He'd get out with a sigh of pleasure when we stopped.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Now
I was the brewer of coffee, and my crew suffered because of my inflated
ego.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't excuse my failure by
saying that the damn fool never taught me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He'd said something about a bucket and water and coffee and sugar and
milk, but I figured, "Why strain?"<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I'd drunk the stuff and knew what it was supposed to look and taste
like, so I just nodded my head and he just left me to my doom.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
filled the five-gallon bucket with water and brought it to a boil.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I dumped in the bag of coffee, the
evaporated milk and the sugar and stared a little uncomfortably at what I had
wrought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tasted the gloppy mess; the
coffee grounds were sand in my mouth and the coffee liquid was neither black
nor white; it looked like chicken egg drop soup, except the stringy floating
stuff was a dirty white.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At lunchtime I
had to face twenty accusing tree-trimmers and one USFS man, who looked at me as
though I were Benedict Arnold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't
know how they chewed and swallowed that glop down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hunger works wonders, I guess.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But they weren't timid about complaining about curdled milk and suspended
coffee grounds and they weren't timid about threatening either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Learn!" was the unanimous order.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
learned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I learned a little humility on
the side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All I had to do was to dump a
canful of cold water into the boiling coffee before I added the evaporated
milk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That settled the coffee grounds
and allowed the milk to color the brew that lovely coffee color.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was accepted.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
chore consisted of starting a fire that would boil the water; that wasn't
hard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Getting the water was sometimes a
bit of a problem.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were no faucets
around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Water is frozen at twenty above
but not all the way down to the bottom of running creeks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had to find a stretch of ice, break
through and plunge my bucket into the water, bring it out brimming, and place
it in the glowing embers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Simple?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was, unless I overreached myself and the
ice cracked beneath my feet so that I was chest deep in the cold, cold stream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would get a little scary as I failed to
clamber out, the thin ice snapping under the weight of my pressing hands, but I
learned to climb out wriggling my snaky way to safety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few minutes in front of the fire tending
the bucket would bring comfort to me and I'd sneer at minor cataclysms.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Paul
Kustich was the blacksmith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
twenty-four and came from New Hampshire.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He rolled his own and always spoke with the fat, twisted cigarette in
his mouth; his head tilted to catch the full effect of the smoke in his
eyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was a great talker, a bit of a
braggart, but quite a capable guy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
boxed with him once, and he complimented me while he directed me on how to
improve myself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought I could have
taken him, but we got along too well to ever have to prove anything.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">There
was a younger fellow watching us who wanted to box with me in the worst way,
and even though I had everything to lose and nothing to gain, I allowed myself
to be persuaded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another time he
boasted that he often beat the best arm wrestlers in his town.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He got me into a stupid dare proposition
then, but I'd put him down with ease.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As the saying goes, he was built like a brick shithouse, short and
squat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He put the gloves on and came at
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was just going to spar but he
came in for the kill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I succeeded in
staving him off, but he hit my harm hard enough to make me wince.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He kept boring in and I snapped out my
left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think I was more surprised than
he was when it met his jaw and he went down on his back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think it was his speed, not mine, that
floored him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He jumped up quickly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps a wee bit shakier, but he repeated
his charge with the same result.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
third time he went down hard, I quit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
started tugging my gloves off but I needed help with the knots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The kid begged me to continue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wouldn't.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It seemed stupid as sin to me.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
found out that they had a photo lab in camp and asked permission to use
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think the Educational Advisor was
happy to see something used.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't
think he understood what his job was.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Generally, it was meant to motivate the campers towards some educational
goal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The specifics seemed to evade
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The photo lab was great.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had chemicals for mixing developers and
fixers and stainers, and a print box; and it even had film and paper, besides a
one-twenty Kodak box-camera.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was
a scale for measuring metric weights, and there were easy to follow direction
booklets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was like stepping into
heaven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I started taking advantage of
it right away.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
Educational Adviser was pleased with the way I worked and I was informed one
morning that I had been taken off my truck, given two stripes, a raise in
salary, and appointed Assistant Educational Adviser.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was billeted in a barracks that contained the doctor's office,
a pessimistic infirmary which contained a dozen cots with room for a dozen more
and the Educational Adviser's office, which for all intents and purposes,
became mine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A small area of the
infirmary was sectioned off to be used for small club meetings or as a
classroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Several stacked desk-chairs
were available for use.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
believed I'd found my true calling, but I had a come-down when I tried to teach
illiterates who were eighteen to twenty-four how to read and write the English
language.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They weren't rebellious,
though they were ordered to attend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I guess
they'd quit trying long before, or else I just didn't have the knack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd get a rise<span style="">&nbsp; </span>out of the tiniest spark and encourage the hell out of them but
in the end I felt like a betraying Judas.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They needed more than I could give them, and they needed it a whole lot
sooner.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
wasn't a good typist and I hadn't done any mimeograph work, but I improved my
typing and learned how to put out a mimeographed newspaper with perfect
margins.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was an
accomplishment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I persuaded some
fellows to feed me whatever they felt was interesting and I gave them
by-lines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did all the editing, the
typing, the mimeographing, the stapling and the delivering.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fellows got a kick out of seeing their
names in print.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also put out a
premiere edition of an annual magazine that contained poetry and the usual dull
greetings from administrators and camp personnel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went a step beyond the ass-licking crap by inducing thru
flattery or persuasion several guys, who had gained the respect of their
campmates, to contribute creative material that I edited very carefully.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes I'd just interview a prospect, put
the article together and sign it with his name.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
issue was well received and Captain Cassell arranged for a few of the guys who
had contributed to the magazine to be invited to Spokane, Washington, to go on
the radio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was included because of my
dedicatory poem, "Welcome, You Rookies," inspired by Pere Lorentz's
documentary <i>The River</i>.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
interviewer wasn't very well prepared.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>None of us had been on radio before and the fellows were nervous, a
little hesitant, stumbling and flubbing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I ate it up when my turn came, and my quick responses threw the
interviewer, and he flubbed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I covered
for him so that there was no dead spot on the air.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After air-time he shook my hand and thanked me profusely</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
guess I was a kind of show-off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr.
Eric Lehr's eyes bugged when I mentioned Hutchinson's Teeth, an indicator of
hereditary syphyllis, to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He used
me as an assistant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd always been
interested in the noblest of professions, medicine, until I had close contact
with that butcher.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He was in a blue
funk during an emergency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some unlucky
kindling-chopper hadn't been wary enough and had almost severed a thumb; it
hung by some shreds of skin and tendons.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A butcher would at least have gotten through with it, but the nervous
doctor took forever cutting it off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
think my presence from then on made him feel guilty about it because his
attitude definitely cooled towards me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I think he convinced himself that I indulged in heinous practices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never could get him to divulge what
horrible, secret vice he thought I indulged in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's possible he'd eavesdropped on something uncomplimentary I
said about him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He blustered something
at me one day, but wouldn't explain.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
had heard vices abounded in some CCC camps.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Men in the full flush of their maleness, finding themselves in
unrelieved isolation in desert land without women for six months at a clip, may
have gone a little mad, or perhaps blown off some steam to remain sane.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a conversation at a bar about a half-hour
from camp, a companion confided that a group of fellows would form a ring
facing inwards, their flies open, and make up a pot which was collected by the
one who, on the word "Go," ejaculated first.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My prudish, prurient, Victorian soul was vomitoriously
disgusted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The "Never, never,
never's" dwindle through the years of passion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We lived in a pretty hypocritical haze then, as now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Boys were steeped in sin at an early age; I
surmise that girls were too.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
at Camp 3277 had Saturday nights and Sundays off, and we had Priest River or a
roadhouse-canteen to satisfy our wishes or needs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The barkeep at the roadhouse was a not-bad looking woman of about
thirty with a mouth as salty as any I'd ever heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was polite enough, but she took no sass from anybody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some nights the place would fill up, the
juke box would see heavy service, and there were girls, girls, girls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night I used my fake Irish brogue to
fascinate the daughter of the head of our forestry service.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was just about to lead her outside for
some smooching when she whispered, "I'm sick."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't get her drift, but I dropped
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just didn't understand that
Idaho language.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maybe I was still too damn
naive.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">That
night was one of the most exciting and dangerous in my life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were five of us left when we
discovered we'd been left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our camp
transportation had gone without us!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
hell of a long walk appeared in the offing until a couple of thirty-year old
staggerers volunteered to drive us home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was one of the three sitters who supported two guy who sat in our
laps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The driver raced the motor, sang
out, "Let's fly, buddies."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And we scorched the tires taking off.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">They
were members of the Civil Aeronautics Authority, and they were flyers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had imbibed a bit<span style="">&nbsp; </span>much.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They treated those icy, downhill, horseshoe curves like they were
asphalt straightaways.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't know if
they went over sixty; I couldn't see the speedometer through the guy sitting on
my lap, but it felt like a hundred!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We fellows
were given a demonstration of high-flying on the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wanted to beg them to stop and let me off
but I'd die first.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I held fast to my
pride and just prayed I'd only break a leg or an arm or both legs because I
couldn't believe those skids, those lurching swings, or whatever was going on
with my eyes tightly shut.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd been
nervous going at sane speeds down these treacherous ruts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I guess somebody up there was looking out
for us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We got back to camp, out of the
car on quivering legs, and thanked them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They burned rubber leaving us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We staggered soberly to our cots.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Polo
had quit after his last hitch and the Company Commander had searched for a new
Topkick.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The major qualification was
toughness, with brains running a distant ninth or tenth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I suggested that the toughest guy in camp, a
six-foot-two, two-hundred-fifty pound Italian from Brooklyn could control the
camp, if he could be controlled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
didn't phase Captain Cassell and Tony was appointed.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">A
soft, good-looking kid from Wichita was billeted in the infirmary with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was the radio operator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He'd been transferred from Harry
Goldschlagg's camp to get our radio operations going.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Harry, by the way, was now the Topkick of his camp and Wichita
told me that he'd gotten the shit kicked out of him by an Assistant Leader who,
though smaller, was a great deal tougher.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Tony
was taken by Wichita and flirted outrageously with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maybe he was just a big kidder out to get a
rise out of the kid, but his face would swell up, redden, and look as
lascivious as a comic-book rapist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
don't think he ever got anyplace.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wichita
was unhappy by the attention and didn't want to be alone with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tony started to come into the infirmary
after lights out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He'd entertain us
with some immodest stories of his pugilistic prowess.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He'd lead up to a climax and explode with a "Pow! I knocked
that son-of-a-bitchin' cop right on his ass."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was hard not to believe him, his stories were too vivid.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He was real Mafia material.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
got tired of his repeat performances and started greeting him with, "Fuck
off, will ya.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We're tired and we're
tired of this shit."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We'd yell and
finally he'd leave and eventually he never came back.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
was asked by the Company Commander to call people down to the educational
building and have them print their names and addresses on three-by-five
cards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I suspected the reason and
didn't feel good about being a stooge, but I went through with it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Somebody had been pinning notices to the
camp bulletin board complaining about the food.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He'd printed the notices in order to disguise his
handwriting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, he had a
particular way of printing which the Company Commander had noticed, and the
culprit was caught and discharged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
didn't know what that meant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maybe he
was saved from the honor of being drafted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If not me, then...?</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
main job of the USFS had changed from thinning out the forest to replanting
seedlings and fighting fires.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
fellows would come in after hours if a fire lasted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They'd come back with their faces blackened with smoke smudged by
their teary eyes, their clothing scorched and having to be awakened before
clambering wearily off the trucks to totter to their barracks or to the mess
hall to wolf down some sustenance before retiring to bliss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rules of cleanliness were temporarily
dispensed with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never had the
pleasure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I regret the loss of the
experience.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
was elevated to the three-stripe position of Company Clerk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think I was the only one in camp who could
type.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day, between enlistments,
only the cadre and a few reenlistees were left in camp and Paul Kustich came to
tell me he and a few of the fellows were going to town.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked if I wanted to go along.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told him that I had some things I wanted
to do, and somebody had to stay in camp.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was awakened in the middle of the night by the Educational Adviser,
who while weeping, frantically told me that the truck had gone off a cliff and
six of our boys were killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I calmed
him as well as I could and we sat up and mourned.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
Company Commander asked me to send the letters to the bereaved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was deeply saddening to read the simply
couched replies.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">Emaciated and bald save for wisps of white
hair at his temples, my father lay with </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">one narrow plastic tube dripping nutrients into his lower arm,
another winding unseen from beneath the hospital sheets to carry off
waste.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not seem to know me. and
when he tried to speak, nonsense emerged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is not the dying who see their lives flash by, I was discovering, but
those who watch them die.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">There was a time when I was </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: 0.7pt;">little</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.1pt;"> and my father </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: 0.9pt;">still</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.1pt;"> lived and was able
to love me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">was a wheat farmer, a midwesterner
descended from generations of men close to the soil in America and before that
in England, a lover of the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
would sit on his lap in the tractor under <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">the
cloudless sky, and he would pretend to let me steer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The aroma of freshly turned soil would fill </span>my nostrils,
and the shimmering speck of a plane would drone above us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every once in <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">awhile, as though </span><span style="letter-spacing: 0.9pt;">telling</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;"> me for the first time, he would spread his arms,
thick as tree trunks in my </span>imagination, to encompass the land, his land,
that reached as far as we could see.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>&#8220;We feed the world,&#8221; he would say.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>&#8220;People can do without many foods, Georgie, but not grain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The staff of <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">life, the Bible </span>calls<span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;"> </span>it.&#8221;<span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>And he
would pull in his arms and fold them around me until the tractor </span>began
to veer from its path.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Trips off the land were great occasions, glimpses of other
worlds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Except when the roads were
snowed in, there was church every week, an eight-mile drive over narrow and
bumpy <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">blacktop that dipped from center to
shoulder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The church stood just back
from the main highway, the only building in sight other than a Texaco station
three hundred yards further along and a silo </span>on the horizon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the service, while my parents
exchanged greetings with our minister and <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">fellow-worshipers,
I would drift to the highway&#8217;s edge to inhale wafting petroleum aromas from the
</span>gas station and watch for out-of-state license plates.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">The best outing was the twenty-mile ride to
Great Plain with its concrete sidewalks and a </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">main street lined with offices and diners and stores and a
public library.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On Veterans&#8217; Day, my
father would dig out the sergeant&#8217;s uniform he had worn in jungle battles on
Pacific islands he could no longer name and take us to town to attend the memorial
service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And each fourth of July we
would drive in for the parade and barbecue followed by orange popsicles and a
fireworks display.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the parade,
my sisters and I would take turns perching on his shoulders to see over the
crowd.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There came a year when I tapped
his arm to lift me up and he told me I was too big; I worked my way to the
front of the crowd so I could see for myself, but the view wasn&#8217;t the same.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I was a weak boy, introspective and withdrawn, and I did not take
readily to the labor of farm life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
my father behaved as though I were as powerful and able as he.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can remember when I was smaller than the
heavy sacks of fertilizer he had me drag from the storehouse and lean against
the side of our decrepit flatbed truck that flaked red paint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would inch backwards, <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">grasping a sack with both hands as if tugging a
corpse by the shoulders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I had
lined </span>up half a dozen, he and I would hoist them onto the truck,
grunting together as he took most of the weight upon himself.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">When I was eleven I announced over dinner that I did not want to
be a farmer when I grew up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My little
sister, retarded from birth, laughed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My older sister, Sarah, was leaning an elbow on the table while pushing
her fork to shape her mashed potatoes into plowed fields.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">My father asked, &#8220;What do you plan to be, then?&#8221;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;An actor.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I loved the
movies, especially old films starring Red Ryder or Hopalong Cassidy or Roy
Rogers.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&#8220;Then who am I going to leave...&#8221;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">From the sideboard where she was spooning out dessert my mother
interrupted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Stan, no quarreling at
the dinner table.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sarah, how many times
have I told you to sit up and eat like a lady?&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">My father looked
over my mother&#8217;s head, out the window behind her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He lay his fork and knife across his plate and stood up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;It looks like rain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I better get the tractor in the shed.&#8221;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">&#8220;We&#8217;re in the
middle of dinner,&#8221; my mother said.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t hungry
anyway.&#8221;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">At the one-room
grammar school that I reached by bicycle, the other children tolerated </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">my withdrawn ways.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when I
went to the regional junior high school in Great Plain, my </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">physical awkwardness and preference for reading rather than cars and
sports made me a loner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Goading boys
would surround me like gamblers at a cock fight, egging one another on until </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">someone shoved me, or punched me in the chest or shoulder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day I came home, lips tight </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">and eyes glaring with misery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
father whispered with my mother while she sliced vegetables for dinner, and
then he turned to me and said, &#8220;Put on a jacket and come with me, Georgie.&#8221;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">He led me
outdoors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a late fall day with
the smell of snow in the air.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We walked
toward the fields, long since bare from the harvest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I gazed straight ahead, hands deep in my </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">pockets against
the cold.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">&#8220;Your mother and I
think something&#8217;s troubling you,&#8221; my father said, and proposed </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">causes for me to choose among: teachers, grades, illness, growing
up&#8212;even girls, which made </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">me bristle in horror, for I still had
nothing to do with them and could not yet see why older boys </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">did.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

talk about it,&#8221; I finally said without looking at him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I sniffled against the </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">wind that
scudded the plain, and my eyes teared at the cold.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

any friends visit for a long time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why

volume as though he were talking to himself, he proceeded to show me how to
box&#8212;how to hold my feet and arms and fists, how to keep my chin tucked in, how
to jab </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">and parry.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He would thrust his own fists through my meager defense and jar my body

and wait for me to get up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
miserable, but desperate to please him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It took a long time on that hard, cold </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">plain before
he stood back and said, &#8220;All right.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That&#8217;s enough for now. Let&#8217;s go back to the </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">house.&#8221;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

handkerchief and wiped it back and forth across my nose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We began to walk home, and he coached me in
a low voice that was sometimes lost in the wind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;When you </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">hit, hit hard as you can.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know you may get hurt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But they only keep it up because they think </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">you&#8217;re an easy

quizzical look as we passed silently through the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went to my room, and when my body finally
stopped trembling, I started composing a book report for school.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

recess, Carl Vandergast pushed me and </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">whacked my
shoulder with the side of his hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
could remember nothing from my father&#8217;s instructions-how to stand, how to jab,
how to defend myself&#8212;nothing except his threat and my </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">promise, and I closed my eyes, lowered my head, charged forward and
flailed my arms in front </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">of me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could feel Carl retreat as I pressed forward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most of my blind blows missed, but a few
caught his chest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps he was only surprised,
for after several moments he stopped giving </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">ground, and I felt
two sharp punches to my shoulders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
wanted to cry, but I swung out and my </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">fist, as if of its
own accord, landed in his stomach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
blow, aimed at my chest, went wild, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">crashing against my
cheek, jerking my head to one side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
fell to my knees but no further, while </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">he doubled over, gasping.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">I nodded.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

said.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Keep it up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They&#8217;ll leave you alone soon enough.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I waited, thinking </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">he would demand details, but he turned to his newspaper and let me
escape.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

more fights in the coming days, and I performed no better than the </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">first&#8212;worse, in fact, because now the other boys were expecting it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each day I would give my </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">father a brief

caught me fighting and sent the ether boy and me to the principal&#8217;s </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was ashamed and
terrified; I was always the good boy at school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The principal lectured us and gave us notes to bring home </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">to our parents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Full of dread,
I sought out my father after school to hand him the note in </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">private; I couldn&#8217;t bear to have my mother know what was happening, and
I was grateful that she had been accepting, however hesitantly, the accidents I
was inventing to explain the occasional </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">bruise that appeared on my face.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

Goodwin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She&#8217;s right to do this; it&#8217;s
her job, and she&#8217;ll </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">have to punish you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But you&#8217;re not to stop fighting back, do you

predicted, the fights began to tail off.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When several days had passed </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">without a fight, he
left me alone, and we never spoke about them again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Kids still teased me, but their insults came casually, almost
like greetings when passing in the hall or jostling in the lunch </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">line.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

from oppression at school, I now bore a new weight&#8212;two new weights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">For though I did
not tell my father, in my heart I felt tainted by the way I won my liberation,
and </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">in feeling tainted, I knew I fell short of his
expectations of me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As an adult, I came
to under</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">stand that his behavior grew from love, that
he suffered while he taught me to become what the </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">world had told him a man must be.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But no understanding could displace my secret guilt, and now, as his
shrivelled body finally gave up the ghost, I felt release amid my grief, and I </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">lamented the price of my freedom.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I cried at the funeral, but whether for him or myself, I do not </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">know.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

suspended from school for fighting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was the first time he&#8217;d been caught, though not the first time he&#8217;d

Chicago suburb, in a time </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">when kids have learned to carry

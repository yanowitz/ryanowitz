without a friend to celebrate because all </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">his adult life he had guarded his privacy and
taken jobs like window washing or street </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">sweeping or cleaning offices after closing
time to have enough money not only for rent on </span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">his one-room apartment and basic foodstuffs like white
bread and peanut butter and pork <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">and beans
which he could heat in the can but also for his daily bag of pork rinds and the
Sunday bacon and frozen waffles which he prepared under the grill in his gas
stove that </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">looked like something his
grandmother who died of asphyxiation in his arms would have </span>considered
an antique.</span></small></font></small></p><small>

</small><p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><small><font size="-1"><small><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">So for his fortieth birthday Franklin
sacrificed next Sunday&#8217;s bacon and waffles to buy an Entenmann&#8217;s cake at the
convenience store two blocks away and then lurched back </span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">home through the falling snow to set the
cake on the formica kitchen table at one end of <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">his room and see how long he would leave it uncut to admire its
immaculate integrity while </span>he caressed the barrel of the semi-automatic
weapon he had bought two years earlier with <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">the
$500 in twenty-dollar bills he had found in a lower right-hand desk drawer at
the tax preparer&#8217;s office he was cleaning through an agency when the cleaner
they normally sent </span>died suddenly of the pneumonia she had left untreated
for nearly a month and used the <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">money to
take a Greyhound bus 400 miles down the east coast to Virginia where no laws
inhibited his purchase of this beauty along with two boxes of ammunition and
enough </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">money left over when he got
home with his purchases cunningly packed in a suitcase to buy </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">not only a ticket but also popcorn at the Norwood
movie theater </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">which actually had
been a very disappointing film if he was completely honest with </span>himself.</span></small></font></small></p><small>

</small><p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><small><font size="-1"><small><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The cake remained intact while Franklin finished that day&#8217;s bag of
pork rinds&#8212;did I forget to mention that he bought them at the same time as the
cake?&#8212;reaching one hand <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">like a metronome
between his mouth and the bag gripped by his thighs while studying the current
day&#8217;s program listings in the free week&#8217;s TV listing from the convenience store
and con</span>tinuing to stroke the rifle&#8217;s barrel with the other hand until he
could detect no further pork rind crumb in the corners of the bag and crumpled
it to throw in the corner but missed <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">by a
yard the rest of the week&#8217;s trash pyramided alongside the four-cubic-foot
refrigerator that always needed defrosting before laying the rifle the long way
across the table to stand and fetch his bowie knife and wipe its edge on the
clean patch of shirt just below his left </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">armpit prior to sectioning the cake into six pieces which he devoured by
hand one by one at even intervals until he could lick the last smudges of
chocolate icing from his fingers and </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">slump
with content against the torn vinyl back of the kitchen chair one hand upon his
</span>stomach that felt as though someone had inflated a balloon in it and the
other upon the butt of the rifle as if the hand were an award ribbon from a
bake contest in the county fair <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">that set up
every year on the field beside the fire station a half-mile down the road from
the </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">egg farm where he grew up with an
emaciated father who despaired of making a living </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">from the farm and an elegant mother who drank all
day long but never showed the effects </span>as far as Franklin could see.</span></small></font></small></p><small>

</small><p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><small><font size="-1"><small><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">That morning Jacqueline Johnson (who still
found a special charm in the matching initials she obtained by marrying Marcus)
finished plumping the pillows beneath her hus</span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">band on the living room couch where he
could watch television to mitigate the misery of his </span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">flu, reminded him to drink all the orange
juice he could stand so he could return to his job <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">assembling razors at the Gillette factory, packed her lunch in a small
brown paper bag and </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">took herself off
in her discolored navy down parka to her own job at the reception area of </span>the
Federal Building at Government Center.</span></small></font></small></p><small>

</small><p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><small><font size="-1"><small><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">While she sat at the end of the car with her
back to the window on the Orange Line </span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">train rattling its way north towards her destination she thought
about their son Floyd and <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">wished they hadn&#8217;t
named him after a boxer even though it was to give him pride in himself </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">because instead it seemed at fifteen only to have
made him expect everyone to submit to his strength so that yesterday evening
she had had to undergo another meeting with the </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">school principal over Floyd&#8217;s fighting in the lavatory which was
especially exasperating </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">because he
was so good with his studies and not ashamed to show it and could one day
become a doctor or lawyer or teacher if only he would control his need to fight
that was so great she and Marcus wondered if she herself was reinforcing his
belief that might makes </span>right.</span></small></font></small></p><small>

</small><p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><small><font size="-1"><small><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">Later that day Franklin&#8217;s cunning surprised
even himself when he slipped into a </span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">raincoat from a rack at Filene&#8217;s Basement and hovered near a checkout
area to exit when the nearest cashier became distracted by a bar code reader
refusing to display a price on <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">the register
after repeatedly scanning the ticket attached by a plastic stud to a satiny
half-slip being purchased by an elderly short woman with hennaed bouffant hair
that partially </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">hid a narrow scar
running from her ear to her chin to find himself free in Downtown Cross</span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">ing and walking to South Station to extract from
locker 3482 his loaded semi-automatic </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">rifle
wrapped so loosely in newspaper that no shape had been recognizable when he
carried </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">the bulky package under his
arm ignoring empty seats and standing all the way into town on the commuter
train impatient for this moment when the two arcs of his plan could meet </span>in
the men&#8217;s room stall where he unbundled the rifle and removed the raincoat and
wrapped one within the other though he could not fully disguise the rifle&#8217;s
shape so that when he moved back into the station and then through the downtown
streets treacherous <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">with ice fused by
hundreds of thousands of footsteps into irregular curves like an abstract
sculpture of a miniature rolling prairie he expected at any moment to be
challenged by the </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">masses of people
who were actually intent only on completing lunchtime errands.</span></span></small></font></small></p><small>

</small><p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><small><font size="-1"><small><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">When Franklin walked into the lobby of the
Federal Building to unveil his rifle and </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">spray shots in all directions Jacqueline was
counting the minutes until she could go to lunch </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">and phone home to remind Marcus to
take his orange juice before she bought herself a can </span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">of Diet Coke and sat in the building&#8217;s
cafeteria with the medium-rare roast beef-and-butter <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">sandwiches on whole wheat bread and blueberry muffin from Dunkin Donuts
in her lunch </span>bag stored behind the information counter in the lobby so
that the suddenness of the <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">assault combined
with three years experience in the hectic lobby without needing to strongarm
anyone other than dragging an occasional political protester to a paddy wagon
much less draw her gun made her hesitate when she heard the initial shots and
saw people falling and bleeding but she was still the first to have her pistol
out and braced with both </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">hands as she
raced at the madman whose finger was working rhythmically as if counting </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">pills into a vial but thank goodness she thought
he seemed not to be aiming the rifle </span>because only one bullet nicked her
right shoulder to make her feel without seeing the <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">trickle of blood onto her dark-blue uniform and down towards her
silvered badge but since </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">she was
left-handed she continued to steady her gun with the good hand to pump her own
bullets into the crazy man until her trigger clicked without firing and she
could watch his </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">rifle fall to the
floor and as if by spontaneous combustion fire a single final shot which </span>pierced
one temple and came out the other of a seven-year old girl with two blonde
braids held by blue ribbons who lost her wide-mouthed grip at the bottom fringe
of her mother&#8217;s <span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">pink turtle-neck blouse and
slid to the floor while Franklin fell on his side with blood </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">drooling from a corner of his lips just like in
the movies and his unseeing eyes watching </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.05pt;">Jacqueline&#8217;s left shoe graze his face as her adrenalin carried her over
his body to tumble </span>onto her wounded shoulder and roll herself into a
ball of pain.</span></small></font></small></p><small>

husband and son not only why she had </span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">not telephoned all afternoon and early evening so that they
learned about her feat from the <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">six o&#8217;clock
news for which she had refused interviews but also that she felt so unlike the </span>heroine
the reporters were making of her that in the midst of her debriefing upon
return to the Federal Building after being examined and having her shoulder
treated at Massachusetts General Hospital by a red-eyed intern with Dr.
Elizabeth Lopez printed on the <span style="letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">nameplate
pinned to a soiled white smock Jacqueline had told her employers she was quit</span>ting
her job despite their insistence that she was only speaking in the heat of the
moment</span></small></font></small></p><small>

taken several sips from a can of Budweiser light beer she narrowed her eyes and
brought her face six inches from Floyd&#8217;s to </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.1pt;">explain in a voice as gentle and truthful as
a spring breeze that the only reason she would pick up a gun again would be to
come after him if she ever ever ever again learned he was </span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">fighting no matter what the excuse.</span></small></font></small></p><small>

half-gallon container of orange juice he </span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">had begun that morning.</span></small></font></small></p><small>

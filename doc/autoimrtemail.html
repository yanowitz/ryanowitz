<p class="stblpara">&#8220;NEW YORK, September 27, 2006 -- Results from the largest
study of men with prostate cancer treated with high-dose, intensity modulated
radiation therapy (IMRT) show that the majority of patients remain alive with
no evidence of disease after an average follow-up period of eight years. The
561 prostate cancer patients treated with IMRT at Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center were classified into prognostic risk groups. After an average of
eight years, 89 percent of the men in the favorable risk group were
disease-free and none of the men in any group developed secondary cancers as a
result of the radiation therapy. This report, published in the October 2006
issue of The Journal of Urology, is the first description of long-term outcomes
for prostate cancer patients using IMRT&#8230;.</p>

<p class="stblpara">&#8220;Between April 1996 and January 2000, 561 patients with a
median age of 68 (ranging from 46 to 86 years old) were treated with IMRT, an
improved form of three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), also
used in radiotherapy. IMRT uses enhanced planning treatment software that more
precisely targets the prostate, allowing the beam of radiation to deliver a
high dose (81 Gy) to the tumor target while sparing the adjacent bladder and
rectum from exposure to the higher amounts of radiation. Perhaps because of
this, the eight-year results show urinary continence was maintained for all
patients, and only 1.6 percent of the five hundred sixty-one patients
experienced rectal bleeding. The high-dose radiotherapy was curative for the
majority of the patients in all three prognostic risk groups, with 89 percent
of the favorable, 78 percent of the intermediate, and 67 percent of the
unfavorable group alive after an average period of eight years. Of those men
who were potent prior to IMRT, erectile dysfunction developed in 49 percent.&#8221;</p>

<p class="stblpara">Now this report does not seem to include statistics for the
last 6 years, when I expect techniques and statistics have improved
considerably, but I am concerned about how these numbers match up with my profile
(which I assume is the &#8220;favorable risk group&#8221; referred to here), especially the
89% cure rate (vs. the 95% we discussed) and the 50-50 erectile dysfunction
rate (vs. the 85-15 rate we discussed).</p>

<ol style="margin-top: 0in;" start="3" type="1"><li class="MsoNormal" style="">I
     want to make sure I understand a point we went over at length and that for
     some reason I found very hard to grasp&#8212;about what happens if the cancer
     recurs down the line.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here is my
     understanding at this point:</li></ol>

<p class="stblpara" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]-->a.<span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->With either radiation treatment, if the cancer recurs the
prostate will have to be removed, and the only method (with existing medical
technology) is the old-fashioned radical prostatectomy that has a high risk for
impotence and incontinence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
addition, there is a high likelihood that the cancer will have spread
elsewhere, especially the bones, and be much more serious and life-threatening.</p>

<p class="stblpara" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]-->b.<span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->With Da Vinci, the prostate of course will already be
out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is possible that the recurrent
cancer will be in the immediate vicinity, but as with radiation, the likelihood
is high that the cancer will now be present elsewhere and be very serious.</p>

<p class="stblpara" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]-->c.<span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->Therefore, regardless of the cure I now choose, recurrence
will likely kill me in short order, and life quality (sexual potency and
continence) at that point will be of low concern.</p>

<ol style="margin-top: 0in;" start="4" type="1"><li class="MsoNormal" style="">By
     looking at web information, I understand that the goal of IMRT is to give
     small radiation doses over a long time that add up to a large enough dose
     (the 81 Gy cited in the above article) to kill any cancer present both
     within and at the edges of the prostate.<span style="">&nbsp;
     </span>I assume among other things that this is how IMRT compensates for
     the uncertainty of whether the Gleason rating is accurate (that is,
     whether the biopsy missed cancer internal to the prostate).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But how do we know that the 81Gy is
     sufficient in all cases?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or is
     that a compromise number that works in enough cases to give the same cure
     rate as the other methods?</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="">As
     I recall, it takes about 6 weeks of preparation before actually starting
     IMRT, which would get me started around late November/early December
     (depending on when the preparation period could start).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am wondering if I might then be
     hitting a 2-day Thanksgiving holiday and 2-day Christmas and New Year&#8217;s
     holidays plus multi-day blizzard stoppages, and if so whether cumulatively
     such interruptions would be too long.<span style="">&nbsp;
     </span>I guess my general question is, given that you want to hit a
     regular 5-day/week schedule (minus occasional 1-day holidays), what are
     the provisions for such extra interruptions (and I guess I should include
     illness in that list&#8212;yours or mine)?<span style="">&nbsp;
     </span>At what point do interruptions give the cancer cells time to
     regenerate?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Do<span style="">&nbsp; </span>you just lengthen the treatment, or
     does the efficacy of the treatment get compromised?</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="">I
     am eager to get on with one of these cures and get this cancer out of my
     body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But given the slow rate of
     its growth and the apparent rapid development of treatment methods, is
     there any <i>compelling </i>reason to consider delaying treatment (say
     6-12 months) for some improved treatment method that is in the pipeline?</li></ol>
<span style="font-style: italic;"></span><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The specialist's reply (we ended up having a long phone call the content of which I cannot remember):</span><br>

<p class="MsoNormal">I am not aware of any head to head comparative information
for IMRT radiation vs. robotic surgery.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This information (or the lack of a randomized trial of the two) is the
basis for all the controversy surrounding surgery and radiation over the last
50 years. The best data still comes from a 1996 NCI consensus conference when
an expert panel was evaluating surgery and radiation for early stage disease.
The conclusion of the conference was that they could not reach a conclusion as
to which one was better and as far as non-randomized trials could determine.
They actually said&nbsp;it deserved more study. The problem is that the study
never has and never will be done because the randomization is too drastic.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In any event I will contact you at home since I am a
terrible typist and it would take me all night to type a coherent reply to your
very excellent questions.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><a href="autoimrtemail.html#topofpage">Top of page</a><br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>Back <a href="autoprostate.html">Me and my prostate</a> page<br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Back to&nbsp;</span><a href="Otherauthobiography.html">Other personal autobiography</a>&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">page<br></span><a href="index.html"><b>HOME PAGE</b></a>&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold; background-color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"></span></body></html>

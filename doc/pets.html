(a crazy woman when it comes to animals) and I have had a number of
cats over our 12+ years living together. &nbsp;We first moved into a
West Village loft in June, 1995, and in September we got our first
cat, Arlo, one year old at the time, from a shelter in
New Rochelle, NY. &nbsp;Arlo died<font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8212;</span></font>or rather was given a lethal
something by our vet<font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8212;</span></font>in 2006 after a long bout with some kind of
feline cancer. For awhile we gave him various medications that
seemed to ease his problems, but one day&nbsp;he suddenly lost all
coordination, and it was time for the final trip to the vet.<br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 390px; height: 298px;" alt="arlo posing" src="arlo%20no%20red%20eye.jpg"> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Arlo on the
bed</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></div><a name="petrushka"></a>Next came two kittens in one
of the next two Februaries. &nbsp;We started with three sisters from a giveaway at a
Manhattan pet shop and returned one. &nbsp;Some months
later, a ginger sister, Annie, was lying on a radiator in our loft
bedroom. &nbsp;I noticed her seeming to stagger. For a moment I
laughed, thinking she, a cat of all creatures, had momentarily lost her
balance. &nbsp;Then I&nbsp;realized something was wrong, especially when
Annie thudded to the floor and lay twitching. &nbsp;I called down to
Maxine, but by the time she got upstairs, I think, Annie was clearly
dead.&nbsp;</div></div><p>The third sister, Petrushka, is
still with us. &nbsp;She has always hated to be held, and for many
years would not even allow herself to be touched (though she did not
spurn the food and water laid out for her). &nbsp;I think she was never
the same after being spayed. &nbsp;Over literally several years<font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8212;</span></font>seven
or eight<font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8212;</span></font>I
would edge up to her and touch her slightly until she got
used to that, then rest my hand on her, then pet her just a bit.
&nbsp;She still hates being held (or even reached for), but for a year
or two she has been coming to me and meowing to be&nbsp; petted. When I
lie
in bed, she will often jump up and settle between the pillows and
expect me to pet her firmly and extensively. (Sometimes I will
make the most innocent move, but she will feel threatened and hurtle
off the bed ) &nbsp;If I want to clip her claws, and therefore grab
her, she seems to pick&nbsp;up my vibes, so that I have to summon my
deepest acting skills and combine (1) finding that place in me that is
totally innocent of ill intent with (2) an agility that can pounce and
hold her as she realizes, too late, that she needs to race to freedom.
&nbsp;When I release her after the manicure, I have learned to position
her very carefully because, as I learned the hard way,&nbsp;when she
senses she can escape she will leap from my lap like a frenzied
demon, pushing off with her extended rear claws. &nbsp;Fortunately,
like most cats, she has no retention span and will be my friend again
several minutes later.</p><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 376px; height: 282px;" alt="petrushka between pillows" src="petrushka%20between%20pillows.jpg"> &nbsp; <img style="width: 375px; height: 282px;" alt="petrushka and arlo and plants" src="https://richardyanowitz.com/petrushkaandarlowithplants%20%282%29.jpg"><br></div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;Her

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
With Arlo in our sun room, scoping plants</span> <p><a name="arieh"></a>Our next cat,
Arieh, was a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cfainc.org/breeds/profiles/ragdoll.html">rag doll</a>, passed on to us at a year or older (and with his Israeli name) by a
couple one of whom was allergic to cats. &nbsp;While
they&nbsp;schmoozed us, they laughed about a sibling of his with a
habit of leaving bowel movements in the bath tub, and weren't we lucky
we were getting THIS cat instead.</p><p>Need I add that THIS cat indeed
loved our bathtub as a toilet (also at times the floor, though I think
he was acting out when he did this)? &nbsp; When he did use the litter
box (which was most of the time), he perched precariously on one corner
so that he would not soil his paws in the litter (though he did climb
in to cover up his leavings). &nbsp;Chewing leather was a favorite
activity (including the pocket of a prized leather jacket belonging to
Anthony who at the time was still in the early stages of dating Laura),
as was dashing outdoors past our feet if he could manage it.</p><p>Oh yes: Arieh also came to us with a congenital bronchial defect that killed him soon after Arlo<font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8212;<big>or rather, like Arlo, he suddenly lost control of his body and we had to let him fall off the radiator.</big></span></font></p> <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 450px; height: 228px;" alt="Arieh on our bed" src="arieh%20on%20our%20bed.jpg"><span style="font-style: italic;"><br></span><span style="font-style: italic;">Arieh

years since I had known her, Maxine had been pining for a bird, some
kind of parrot. &nbsp;Finally, I said to her, "We're not getting
younger, so why don't you get the damned bird sooner rather than
later." &nbsp;This was while Arlo and Arieh were both alive. &nbsp;So
after some research and visiting stores, Maxine bought a <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/cockatoo-2">cockatoo</a>
and named it (we never learned its sex but I always thought of it as
female) Twinkie. &nbsp;I will not reveal here the exorbitant cost of
bird with accoutrments.</p><p>We were afraid the cats would have a very
expensive lunch once Twinkie was in their midst, but in fact she
intimidated them. &nbsp;The cats seemed more curious than predatory,
but if they got too close, Twinkie would squawk and peck viciously at
them. &nbsp;An uneasy truce prevailed. &nbsp;However, Twinkie was also
something of a terror with humans. &nbsp;Biting, chewing up books and
papers, shrieking when she felt like it. &nbsp;Her depradations were
mitigated by having her wings clipped so she couldn't fly well and by
covering her cage at night so that when it got light outdoors she was
often fooled into thinking it was still night (and therefore would
remain asleep instead of shrieking).</p><p>There came a time after a
few months when Maxine decided she had had her bird needs met, and
after advertising at a bird vet's office, we found a new owner who
picked up the bird, her cage and playthings, at half what we paid for
all of them.&nbsp;</p><div style="text-align: left;"><img style="width: 498px; height: 370px;" alt="Arlo inspecting Twinkie" src="https://richardyanowitz.com/DSCN0117%20%282%29.jpg"> &nbsp;<img style="width: 315px; height: 374px;" alt="Twinkie with crest displayed" src="twinkie%20sept%2004max002%20crest%20up%20closeup.JPG"><br></div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Arlo

Twinkie had flown to another home but while Arlo and Arieh still alive,
we...obtained...a ginger cat, Lucy, from Maxine's daughter, Karen.
&nbsp;While</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;"> living and working in&nbsp;Florence for three years in the mid-1990s, </span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;">Karen
took Lucy from a litter brought to the office by a colleague who had
found the kittens in the woods near her Tuscany home. &nbsp;Lucy
apparently had the knack of leaping from Karen's first floor (2nd floor
American style) window and landing safely on the ground. &nbsp;When
Karen returned to the U.S., she brought Lucy along, and the two of them
lived contentedly for several years. &nbsp;There came a point a few
years ago, however, when Karen and her to-be husband did not see eye to
eye on Lucy's value, and Maxine and I offered to look after Lucy for
awhile. &nbsp;She is still with us. &nbsp;So for awhile we had four
cats.</span></p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;">In the past year, Lucy has become</span><font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8212;</span></font><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;">how shall I say</span><font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8212;</span></font><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;">large.
&nbsp;She and the other cats never got along especially well, but they
learned to abide each other. &nbsp;More of Lucy's story will come in
the next section, below.</span><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;"><img style="width: 414px; height: 275px;" alt="Lucy working at my desk" src="https://richardyanowitz.com/DSCN0372%20%282%29.JPG"> &nbsp;<img style="height: 276px; width: 387px;" alt="Lucy jan 08" src="https://richardyanowitz.com/lucy%20on%20our%20bed%20jan%2008%20%282%29.jpg"> &nbsp;</span><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;"></span></div><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;Lucy at work on my desk

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lucy on our bed (Jan., 2008)</span></span><p style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;"><a name="blu"></a>After
the demise of Arlo and Arieh, Maxine was distraught at having a mere
two cats and often spoke wistfully of adding another rag doll. &nbsp;So
in mid-November, 2007, a 12-week-old rag doll kitten, Blu, joined our
household. &nbsp;As
with Twinkie, we were concerned about how well he would survive with
two grown, worldly-wise cats. &nbsp;And as with Twinkie, those other
cats have been the ones bullied.&nbsp;Petrushka will hiss and lash at
Blu with with her claws a few times,
and that will be that. &nbsp;But Blu terrorizes Lucy, often waking us
in the night as she howls for him to leave her alone but seems to have
little ability to chase him away.</span></p><p style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;">Is
Blu playing? &nbsp;Does he think this is his mother or siblings?
&nbsp;Is he trying to be sexually active with a spayed, declawed cat
who presumably cannot emit pheromones? &nbsp;We will know better when
Blu is 6 months old and goes for his...mmmm...alteration, though not by
a tailor. &nbsp;When I think of that day,I am torn b etween (1) a
reckless empathetic desire to rescue him from&nbsp;the end of frisky
maleness and (2) gloating over the likelihood that he will be
transformed into a good (i.e., behaving as Maxine and I want) cat.
&nbsp;</span></p><p style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;">One
of Blu's motives (if cats have such: I think he is all id) seems to be
to take over any geography&nbsp;claimed by the older cats. &nbsp;Lucy
and Petrushka do get some revenge by eating Blu's special food (a fact
that has likely contributed to Lucy's...growth), but since that only
means we have to put out more for Blu, he really isn't paying any
freight.&nbsp;</span></p><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;"><img style="width: 378px; height: 326px;" alt="Blu in Petrushka's favorite place" src="https://richardyanowitz.com/blu%20in%20petrushka%27s%20favorite%20place.jpg"></span> <img style="width: 431px; height: 287px;" alt="Lucy on her favorite rocker" src="Lucy%20on%20the%20rocker.jpg"><br><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;"></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp; Blu in Petrushka's favorite place</span></span><span style="font-style: italic;">

the 60s, I&#8217;ve hung onto progressive </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.65pt;">political values without doing
much about them for a long time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A bit
over a </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">year ago, deep in mid-life passage, I drifted into
reading that began to </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">re-organize my assessment of human behavior.
My thinking about social </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">injustices increasingly stressed their
cultural roots, and I grew intrigued </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.55pt;">by the relationship between
culture and biology.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I became
overwhelmed with </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">the imminent prospect of human self-annihilation, slowly
through ecological </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.65pt;">recklessness or quickly via nuclear war
(begun either as a result of resource </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">colonialism or just because it
seemed like a good idea at the time).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">apocalyptic helplessness about the fate of all humanity
made any struggle against more everyday injustices (like poverty, racism,
sexism, governmental </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">or private terrorism) seem especially futile.
At a personal level, I was </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">groping to understand my own place in my
culture, how I could fashion a life style in harmony with my values, how to
protect my body and my son&#8217;s from the</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -1pt;"> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">carcinogens
assaulting them, how to improve intimacy with those close to me.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">I schlepped from the Boston
area to the Maine Summer Institute to </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.65pt;">discuss these social and
personal issues and to learn something about </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">responses to them within
today&#8217;s alternative cultures.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

I felt on the verge of going home, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.65pt;">variously infuriated,
frustrated, perplexed, exhilarated and intellectually </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">energized.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.65pt;">While widely divergent world
views were articulated during the week, the </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">predominant thinking made me
feel intellectually schizophrenic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
kept </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.65pt;">dissenting passionately from what its proponents said while also
feeling that </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">our underlying social concerns were very similar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I write, six months </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">later, I retain this clash of
feelings.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">I want here to explore my
reactions at the conference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
reflections rely on my memory of statements made there; I have read little of
what the </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">participants have written&#8212;and many of them have published
extensively on </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.55pt;">topics I here treat briefly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While I no doubt consequently distort the full </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">subtlety
of their thinking, I should also be a useful case study in public experience of
the ideas these people seek to disseminate.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

spiritual basis of many conference participants&#8217; social attitudes, I need to
note that underpinning my own </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.65pt;">thoughts is a deep and abiding faith in
philosophical materialism, a heartfelt </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">conviction of the non-presence
of any metaphysical realm.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

Ivan<o:p></o:p></span></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">You can&#8217;t appreciate the week
without a sense of the <i>experience</i> of Ivan Illich, who set the tone of
much of the conference and is the focal point of </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.55pt;">the attitudes to which I
reacted so adversely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had heard of
Illich but not </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">read him; nor was I prepared for his dominance of the
week.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">Illich is an aloof, imposing,
brilliant, erudite, charismatic figure </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">with superbly polished
oratorical skills.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He uses gaunt body,
voice and </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.65pt;">language with precision and authority, and even his
unspecific foreign accent </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">lends him an air of distinction and
perspicacity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His encyclopedic command </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">of his
material combined with his philological dexterity give one that helpless
feeling of having neither right nor ability to debate (I almost </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">wrote &#8220;compete&#8221;) intelligently.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">While Illich affects to
exchange ideas (rather than engage in loathsome</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.65pt;">&#8220;communication&#8221;), I experienced many of his statements
as pronouncements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">seemed to
go out of his way to irritate newcomers to his personality, summarizing complex
ideas in pithy terms that sounded outrageous to the </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.55pt;">uninitiated.
At the same time, disagreement appeared both to vex and perplex </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.65pt;">him:
faced on the one hand with the absolute clarity of his Truths in his own </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">mind and
on the other with the inability of many listeners to grasp what he had to say
(= to agree with him), he must have been torn between frustration over his own
apparent failure at lucid articulation and bemusement at the appalling scarcity
of rationality (= sanity) in the people he was </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">addressing.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">When Ivan joined a discussion,
I was dealing with a personality as well </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">as ideas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mind had to become an intellectual and
emotional centrifuge, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">whirling to separate out the impact of his
persona from both the ideological content of a discussion and my own
resistance, in the face of his alienating </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">behavior, to hear his
contributions with sympathy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
problem was </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.65pt;">compounded by the Institute&#8217;s being a kind of reunion
for Illich acolytes and </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">friends, so that I felt like a court
hanger-on with mutually unsavory </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.65pt;">choices: to insinuate myself
into the intellectual aristocracy, or, wallowing </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">in alienation, to turn up my
nose at this incestuous coterie.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">It was rather distressing, as
the week progressed, to find that some of </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.65pt;">these people disagreed with
Illich, and that many of them were actually quite </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">likeable.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

image of aloofness (he seemed much more casual and accessible in private)
cracked, most notably the time during a </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.65pt;">question period after one of
his lectures when Jennifer, who did much of the </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">conference leg work, asked him
where he was coming from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where to a
more </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">aggressive or obviously irritated questioner he might have given a
gnomic answer that detached himself from his subject, to Jennifer&#8217;s
ingenuousness </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.65pt;">Ivan responded openly, even vulnerably, delivering a
moving, personal answer </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">that acknowledged his own participation in
what he was criticizing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">concern
with how we have turned value into commodity, he told us, came from asking
himself how it was that <i>his</i> well-being now required things, like a </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">telephone,
which he used to live comfortably without.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>During this extended </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">commentary Ivan was, for a little while, one
of us, sharing himself as well as his ideas, showing his continuity with the
humanity that inhabits the </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">culture he vilifies.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

sympathizers, I sometimes felt I was </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.65pt;">attending a session of the Republican
platform committee: contemporary values </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">have perverted traditional
ones; let&#8217;s get the government off our backs; local community above all; public
schools corrupt children; get rid of government regulation; beware egghead
institutions (like psychotherapy) that are really out to strip us of our
psychic health and independence.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

I hear populism (which is getting considerable press these days), philosophical
Idealism (things aren&#8217;t what </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">they seem; temporal reality is ultimately a
construct of the human mind&#8212;as </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">in, &#8220;humans beings aren&#8217;t tool-users until
they define themselves that way&#8221;), and European libertarianism (= anarchism,
where individual autonomy is </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">sacrosanct and the State, of course,
malevolent).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The libertarian roots </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.75pt;">would
account for the echoes of certain American right wingism (the kind which </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">confuses
libertarianism with laissez-faire individualism that promotes unfettered free
enterprise and the abolition of social programs), and would </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.65pt;">also help
explain part of my own psychic dissonance in hearing these views: I </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.6pt;">have
always had anarchic tendencies, so that the energy in my dissent might have
arisen in part from projection, from my <i>wishing</i> we could construct the

surely I didn&#8217;t wish to promote it.<span style="">&nbsp;

Blanca Facundo&#8217;s public honesty and <span style="letter-spacing: -0.55pt;">straightforwardness&#8212;not
to mention her willingness to discuss privately </span>with me my views on
sociobiology, a perspective I find as liberating as Darwinism itself but which,
as I discovered at painful first hand, generates venomous hostility from the
left.<o:p></o:p></span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">I found the
intellectual history in Ivan&#8217;s lectures breathtaking in its <span style="letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">insight and scope.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was quite taken with the imagery of his testimony </span>through
silence in demonstrations where he refused to discuss nuclear <span style="letter-spacing: -0.65pt;">weapons (I am thankful that he felt able to speak
long enough about them </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.5pt;">to explain the
protest to us).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he observed that
nuclear weapons </span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">have only one
purpose&#8212;genocide&#8212;I was flooded with that special kind of </span>assent we
experience in the face of an idea which we had never previously thought but
which, once voiced, is too obvious ever to have <span style="letter-spacing: -0.7pt;">considered otherwise.</span><o:p></o:p></span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">An aural
demonstration of the size of nuclear stockpiles left me numb.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The speaker dropped a single b.b. in a
coffee can: the ping represented all the firepower used by all nations in World
War II. Then, slowly, he poured into the can some 5000 more b.b.&#8217;s: to
represent today&#8217;s <span style="letter-spacing: -0.65pt;">nuclear explosive
power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I kept being sure that the
metallic swoosh was about to stop, but on and on it went, conjuring up images
of the world&#8217;s </span>being enveloped with wave after wave of absolute, total
destruction. You cannot read this and appreciate the effect: you must
experience the sound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This eloquence
was provided by a thoroughly straight-looking <span style="letter-spacing: -0.55pt;">businessman
who, totally opposed to nuclear weapons, is striving to </span>promote peace
with a business-oriented program that assumes values (economic growth, the
legitimacy of the marketplace, value as material, profits as goal) which most
of us at the conference aggressively repudiate, whatever our other differences.

known him for years. <o:p></o:p></span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.65pt;">Billie, in charge of our meals, provided not only gustatory pleasure
but </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">also an object lesson in
the chauvinism of the enlightened: when some participants reflexively
identified her as a harried worker, Billie bridled at the intrusion on her life
style and lack of respect for her professionalism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(One can reflect here on the difference between labeling her as
cook [= underpaid servant] or caterer [= creative, <span style="letter-spacing: -0.65pt;">independent entrepreneur].)</span> <o:p></o:p></span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; letter-spacing: -0.65pt;">I was thrilled, after so many hostile public encounters with smokers in
</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">recent years, that most
of the few smokers, without being asked, carefully, thoughtfully, moved away
from the main group while using their drugs.<o:p></o:p></span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">And
I remember conversation after conversation, outside formal conclaves, with people
some of whose names I&#8217;ve now forgotten, but not their energy or commitment or
openness to debate of all kinds.</span></li></ul>

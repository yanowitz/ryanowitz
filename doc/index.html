few weeks back, Barbara and I decided to marry. &nbsp;The date is June
3, 2012. &nbsp;Here is Barbara's take on the decision (from&nbsp;a
message to a friend of hers):</span></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-style: italic;"></span><span><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">I think [Richard] would have been </span></span><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">content to live together with me forever, not married. &nbsp;But that is not </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">my style or my history. &nbsp;Remember that Irwin [Barbara's late husband] and I had a 47-year </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">marriage that was fulfilling and happy. &nbsp;THAT is my model. &nbsp;Moreover, my</span> <span style="font-style: italic; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">model has always included the idea that people live together to "try </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">out" their relationship; if it seems to be working, then they get </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">married--the final commitment. &nbsp;Understanding how important marriage is</span> <span style="font-style: italic; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">to me, Richard quickly&nbsp;got with the program.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-style: italic;">One of these days I will beef up this web site, especially with accounts of my life with Barbara.
&nbsp;For the moment, let me just note that we are having great fun
sitting in together on a Yale course on climate change and human
evolution, topics that interest both of us greatly (Barbara with a
Ph.D. in biology and me with extensive reading in human and cultural
evolution).</span><br></p><p><small>SIDE NOTE: </small><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-style: italic;">For
those who knew Maxine and me, it may be of interest to know that she
and I occasionally communicate (and less occasionally have lunch
together) in a most friendly and supportive manner. &nbsp;We agree that
despite its demise, we had a relationship that was largely good for us
and in which we both grew. &nbsp;Changes I made with her have
contributed to my success in developing a strong, loving relationship
with Barbara; indeed, I have built on those earlier changes and
progressed even farther with Barbara. &nbsp;My hope for Maxine and me
is that we both end up better and happier people, with new partners,
than we managed to be together.</span></p><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>HAPPY NOTE (ADDED APRIL, 2011)<br></span><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></span><p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-style: italic;">Last
August I met Barbara, and in early March we moved in together in a
lovely new house in Hamden, CT. We have committed to spending the rest
of our lives together. &nbsp;More will follow, including photos.<br></span></p><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><br></span><big><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">April 24, 2010, in response to Arizona's enactment of an anti-immigrant law:</span></span></big><br style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span><br style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;">
In the spirit of such traditions as Danes wearing the yellow star, "I
am
Spartacus," "We are all murderers,"&nbsp; Freedom
Rides, Rosa Parks, multi-racial entry into segregated areas, and other
deliberate violation of immoral (by my lights) laws--and (if I understand the law correctly) since&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;">cops would HAVE to
respond--</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;">I offer the following.</span><br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;">
<br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;">
If I lived in AZ, I would encourage a campaign in which all of us "legal"
immigrants/aliens approach&nbsp;cops (and maybe flag them down&nbsp;in cruisers) and say something like: "I may be an illegal
immigrant," "I am an immigrant," "I'm descended from immigrants," followed by, "I
expect/demand/challenge you to check my identification."&nbsp; (My personal favorite would be,&nbsp;"I suspect
myself of being an immigrant," a kind of Yippie locution.)&nbsp; <br><br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;">Since there may be cops who resent the law, too, it would be judicious
to do this in as non-personal a way as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think of
anti-Vietnam war demonstrators putting flowers into the gun barrels of soldiers mustered to "protect" against the protesters.</span><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;"><br>Or
maybe such protesters could
walk the streets with large signs saying something of similar
ilk.&nbsp; (I picture them walking near but not next to each other, as
if being ordinary pedestrians out for a stroll.) &nbsp;Or mass with
such signs outside or inside a police station or legislative offices or
sports stadium or other public place.&nbsp; It would take a large
movement, but enough people (probably most likely in cities and campus
towns) doing this
might actually make a ripple that gets wider attention.&nbsp; </span><br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;">
<br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;">
Then there could be freedom riders of non-Arizona residents coming in to
do the same things. &nbsp;Advance publicity wouldn't hurt.<br></span><br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;">
One's response to a demand for ID could be varied--civil disobedience
(refusal to show it--but have the ACLU's nearest phone number in your
pocket; I don't know what the law does to someone who turns out to be
"legal" but
refuses to cooperate), fumbling for a long time to find an ID (perhaps
while
apologizing profusely or sequentially presenting multiple IDs while
asking, "Will this do?"), whatever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;">Having someone jotting down badge numbers might be wise (though it could also raise the cop's hackles). &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;">Other aspects of the law could be
assailable in parallel ways.</span><br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;">
<br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: normal;">
Less palatable would be groups of people going up to cops and
pointing to strangers, saying, "I suspect that person is an illegal
alien." Better would be&nbsp;groups of like-minded people&nbsp;pointing to each other and
making the accusation.&nbsp; </span><br><br><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>SAD&nbsp;NOTE (ADDED JULY, 2009)</span><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-style: italic;">In

<big style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);"><small><small>DEC.
5, 2007</small></small></big></div>
<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;"></span><span style="color: black;">You
can still see magazine ads today for self-publishing: a
company promises you can forgo the humiliation of rejection by
small-minded
editors and publish a limited run of any work you want.&nbsp;
If you're an unpublished writer, for a
moment you think something like, &#8220;What a great idea!&#8221; followed quickly
by
&#8220;What&#8217;s the catch?&#8221;</span>
<p style="color: black; background-color: white;" class="MsoNormal">The catch, of course, is that
you pay all the publishing
costs and then some.<span style="">* </span></p>
<p style="color: black; background-color: white;" class="MsoNormal">When I first learned of this
some decades ago, I quickly
adopted the&nbsp;attitude that anyone who did this was pathetic,
desperate,
unworthy, and contemptible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
you can&#8217;t
get a legitimate publisher to handle your work, then you shouldn't be
published.</p>
<p style="color: black; background-color: white;" class="MsoNormal">In recent years I became
intrigued with the rapid spread of personal web sites
and blogs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely
this was an example of vanity publishing, but it felt benign, so I am now creating my own web
site.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It represents
to me:</p>
<ul style="color: black; background-color: white;">
<li><i>A kind of autobiography</i></li>
</ul>
<p class="stblpara" style="margin-left: 0.5in; color: black; background-color: white;">At
about the age I am now, my
father wrote <a href="mea%20culpa%20my%20intro.html">memoirs</a>
of his youth&nbsp;that the family has esteemed for its candid
information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ten
years ago I
interviewed his younger sister and wrote
up <a href="mimimemoirstable.html">her memories</a>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
son and his wife have
asked me to write at least about my political past.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Some family members have been encouraged to write
about their
lives but have not (yet, at any rate) done so.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A personal web site offers a form of
autobiography different from a
chronological narrative, and that appeals to me.</p>
<ul style="color: black; background-color: white;">
<li><i>A repository for family information</i><i><o:p></o:p></i></li>
</ul>
<p class="stblpara" style="margin-left: 0.5in; color: black; background-color: white;">Why
not include other family content
like photos or accounts written for special occasions (like <a href="family%2060th%20anniversary.html">my parents' 60th
anniversary</a>)?</p>
<ul style="color: black; background-color: white;">
<li><i>A place to publish my writing and random
thoughts<o:p></o:p></i></li>
</ul>
<p class="stblpara" style="margin-left: 0.5in; color: black; background-color: white;">This
is more important to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over
my adult decades I&#8217;ve written <a href="shortfictionhomepage.html">fiction</a>,
<a href="essays.html">essays</a>, <a href="academic.html">scholarly
material</a>, and virtually none of it has been published
anywhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have a
file of
rejections.<span style="">&nbsp; Trapped in my ego,
how do I judge what I write that should be publishable, what not?
&nbsp;</span>I
have heard successful (i.e., published) authors recount how
they sent submissions that were rejected dozens of times before
acceptance, and how aspiring authors should keep submitting a
manuscript regardless of rejections.&nbsp; Years after
he&nbsp;published
a best seller,
one successful (now deceased) novelist decided to send the manuscript out again under
a
different author's name and title;&nbsp;it was repeatedly rejected.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="stblpara" style="margin-left: 0.5in; color: black; background-color: white;"><span style=""></span>I have found myself hamstrung over the
years
by discouragement over not meeting publication standards, never sure
whether the
rejections were gratuitous or justified, ultimately unable to summon
the inner resources to ignore rejections and keep going.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In recent days, finally, it has struck me
that&nbsp;I can &#8220;publish&#8221;
anything I want according to my own standards, and that is a key part
of my rationale for this web site.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Regardless
of their reception or "objective"** value,
it will purge me to place my efforts where people can publicly see them
if
they
choose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having your
own web site is the
internet version of vanity publishing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If nothing else, I expect my mother will at least
glance over this site.</p>
<p class="stblpara" style="margin-left: 0.5in; color: black; background-color: white;">I
will also use this site to record short and long musings
on&nbsp;topics like <a href="musingsandmeanderingshomepage.html">social
and political matters</a> or <a href="entertainment.html">TV
and film</a>.</p>
<ul style="color: black; background-color: white;">
<li><i>Showing off to people who know me...or don't<o:p></o:p></i></li>
</ul>
<p class="stblpara" style="margin-left: 0.5in; color: black; background-color: white;">Not
unlike <a href="theaterhomepage.html">why I act</a>,
I can&#8217;t escape a truth that publishing, even in this way, is driven in
part by wanting&nbsp;
friends and strangers&#8212;if they'll look at any of my content&#8212;to watch me
perform.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The key to
success here, however, as with acting, is not stopping there and merely
being
self-indulgent but,&nbsp;after admitting
uncomfortable truths like this, to perform professionally, <i>as
if</i> ego
expression isn&#8217;t really at issue.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Only
then does anyone have a shot at&nbsp;performing well.</p>

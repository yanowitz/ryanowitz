<p class="MsoNormal">My father wrote these memoirs some years before 1993, when
the family gave him a bound copy for his 75<sup>th</sup> birthday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->Siince
I remember (or think I do)&nbsp;discussing my first
impressions&nbsp;with someone I was dating&nbsp;1981-1984, he must have
finished them during that time, in his mid 60s. &nbsp;(Is it
instructive that I have created this web site at the age of 65?).</p><p class="MsoNormal">Before he embarked on this quest, my mother extracted a
promise that he would write about nothing from the time they were married,
March 2, 1941, when he was 22.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->Hence, he includes only a few, brief events after their wedding day.&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>



<p class="MsoNormal">While the memoirs have many items of specific interest to
family members, they also provide an interesting<span style="">&nbsp; </span>personal social history of growing up Jewish on Manhattan&#8217;s lower
East Side between the two World Wars.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->This is often not a pretty account, but it is his truth, and reflects a
core part of his personality in its attempts to be frank, even shocking.&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></p>



<p class="MsoNormal">He chose the title <i>Mea Culpa</i>, probably without full
consciousness of how much the title typifies his depressed and guilty feelings
about himself all his adult life (and maybe, given some of the content, well
before adulthood).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->After
the title was "Volume 1," as though he intended to write more, but I
think he really meant that he was only writing part of what he wanted.
&nbsp;(Or perhaps I'm forgetting and these words were added by family
members in hopes he would write more.)</p><p class="MsoNormal">One of my reactions
when I first read his account was that he spent his life feeling he had killed
his mother, and maybe felt responsibility for the deaths of siblings.&nbsp;<!--[endif]--></p><p class="MsoNormal">It
was around the time of his 75th birthday that my father visibly
began a decline into dementia that eventually gave him only the
slimmest connection with reality, most notably his ability to sing
along with show tunes as he watched DVDs of, say, The King and I and
commented on the acting. &nbsp;He died 10 years later, technically
from pneumonia contracted after a month in a nursing home.&nbsp; The
entire family had agreed that it was time for him to be in a home
because my mother, 84, could no longer safely care for him. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Although she had long daily visits there with him, the strange environment
and caretakers probably hastened a death that was no tragedy at that
point. &nbsp;The family had&nbsp;agreed to take no special measures to keep him
alive, and he died peacefully under sedation.<o:p></o:p></p>





<p class="MsoNormal">His memoirs describe his teen-age love of Van Cortlandt
Park in the Bronx, an idyllic escape for him from urban bustle and Depression poverty&#8212;though
it also was the source of captured critters that he brought home to his
mother&#8217;s apparent dismay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he died,
the day after Thanksgiving in 2003, the family scattered his ashes in this
park.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a cold day, very quiet, with snow on
the ground and almost no one else around.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As I stood there, I imagined him at the age of 15, still relatively
innocent (though again, he may not have thought so), reveling in this non-urban
setting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->The
fantasy tore at my heart
for more reasons than I can include here, and I finally cried for what
I still view as his and my failure to establish a strong, fulfilling
father-son relationship.<!--[endif]--><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;</p><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<p class="MsoNormal">Here are prefatory comments from the 1993 volume
prepared for his 75<sup>th</sup> birthday:</p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--><b style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">ED&#8217;S CHILDREN<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class="stblpara" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">We present this volume on the
occasion of your, our father's and grandfather's, 75th birthday.</p>

<p class="stblpara" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The idea, spawned first by Solomon
and Heidi, to bind these memories physically for posterity came aptly at a time
when you have been struggling with fortitude and determination&#8211;and pain&#8211;to hold
onto memory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We can only guess and
flinch at what it is like to watch your mind attempt to betray you, and we can
only admire your refusal to succumb to its subversion.</p>

<p class="stblpara" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">We present to you this physical
repository of your struggle with your past&#8211;and of our gratitude that in the
struggle, so often painful to you (else why the title "Mea Culpa"?
else why seek refuge by allusion to an alien faith?), you kept faith with us,
preserved our birthright for now and always, refusing to become, or make us,
victim to the pain.</p>

<p class="stblpara" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">We cannot absolve you for the sins
you claim to have committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So much consciousness
of sin, so few sins.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After 75 years of
exposure to and immersion in a formidably imperfect world, you know that no
human being is without sin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps,
however, you have still to learn that only you can absolve yourself.</p>

<p class="stblpara" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Make this day, after so many years
of travail and dismay, your own Yom Kippur: you have confessed and atoned for
your sins so many times over, in your head and to those close to you and
finally on paper to the world; now let yourself find peace.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By example you have shown the generations
that follow you how important memory is.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Now show us, too, by equally hard example and not mere smoothing words,
that the sins of the father need not be passed on through the generations, that
we may&#8211;that we should&#8211;remember and cherish the past to release its painful hold
upon us, to reveal our present and brighten our future.</p>

<p class="stblpara" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">If you cannot allow absolution for
yourself for any other reason, then allow it because in showing your pain to us
you have performed a <i style="">mitzvah</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Look at the messages here, at the gratitude
of your descendants (you would hear similarly, I know, from Hy's children and,
I expect, from Mimi's), at the way they find in your pain their own freedom&#8211;not
because you suffered but because the honesty and the openness help us know ourselves,
understand ourselves, connect to our past through you and thereby to ourselves.</p>

<p class="stblpara" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">May the next volume be titled,
perhaps in Yiddish, <i style="">Joys of My Life</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Help us remember that we may revel in life,
that while we cannot escape pain we can&#8211;should&#8211;experience, and pursue,
joy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And that our sins, imagined or
real, should be memorialized (for without memory we become nothing) alongside
our accomplishments and our joys.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
must believe that there comes a time&#8211;and I look to your example to help me
recognize it and know how to manage it&#8211;when we must forgive ourselves our sins,
must even forgive those who have sinned against us, and so not only affirm
ourselves but also show our children that it is, after all, good to be alive.</p>

<p class="stblpara" style="text-align: right; text-indent: 0.5in;" align="right"><i>- Ricky (me, eldest child, b. 1942)<o:p></o:p></i></p>



<p class="stblpara" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">The memoirs give me a connection
with history, a sense of our family's past.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So now, for your 75th birthday, your gift to us we give back to
you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I read these memoirs, I felt
sad, surprised&#8211;and glad to be able to feel connected to you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I finished reading, I wanted to read
more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You make the past real.</p>

<p class="stblpara" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">(<i>David, born September, 1948, his

<p class="stblpara" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Several years ago Edward Yanowitz
saw fit to write his memoirs and make a permanent record of his early life,
perhaps not realizing how important this would be to loved ones in his
family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has linked us to our own
heritage and to the history of part of this country.</p>

<p class="stblpara" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Your words made you more accessible
while rooting us in the past, allowing us to know you in a different way, and
to learn more about ourselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You bind
us better to our past, unite us, and help give us a sense of identity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We may have read about this time in books,
but you gave it a new life, a reality, something special, that made me see you
differently, and you gave a sense of pride to all of us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And pain, too: you shared some of the pain
of our family history, which is also important.</p>

<p class="stblpara" style="text-indent: 0.5in; page-break-after: avoid;">Thank you for
sharing yourself with me and giving me a chance to feel part of something
special, something alive&#8211;the passion of yourself and your mother and your
brothers and your sisters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You welcomed
me into your life in a way that you hadn't before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All this could have been private, but you let me in on it.</p>

<p class="stblpara" style="text-align: right; text-indent: 0.5in;" align="right"><i>- Heidi (Judi&#8217;s first child)<o:p></o:p></i></p>



<p class="stblpara" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">These memoirs are vivid and
alive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They make our family history
come to life, so that I feel connected to the past and our heritage in a way
that I never had.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And I feel more
connected to you: I know you better.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It's so special that you opened up as you did and talked about very
personal matters, shared the pain.</p>

<p class="stblpara" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I especially remember the scenes
with your mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those scenes live
with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think about them all the
time: your mother in her hospital bed, you wanting to protect her from knowing
about death and illness in the family.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It haunts me that you survived this and stayed so strong, were so strong
for the family, that you took so much responsibility for your family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember the love you had for your
mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That's what stands out for me
most.</p>

<p class="stblpara" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I share in presenting this volume to
you because I want you to know how important it has been in my life that you
wrote your memoirs, shared them with the family. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>This volume we present to you is an expression of gratitude, an
expression of love, an expression of appreciation of how important your
memories are&#8211;that your life and past and history matter to me, that it has made
a difference in my life to know more about you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You have made me feel rooted, feel that I had a history.</p>

<p class="stblpara" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;When everyone else was reading the
memoirs I was a little young, so I haven't read them yet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I want to thank Grandpa for keeping the
family history alive, and I look forward to reading them.</p>

<p class="stblpara" style="text-align: right; text-indent: 0.5in;" align="right"><i>-

<p class="stblpara" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;I continue to return to these
writings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I find them powerful,
engaging; they inform my own life.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whenever I come to the end, I feel unfulfilled because this is a story
that continues on, and I pause with sadness as I turn to the last page: I want
to be able to turn yet another page and have the story keep going.</p>

<p class="stblpara" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">I hope this book serves as a model

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in;">I was born in
1919 in Mount Vernon, New York where I grew up. My father was a traveling
salesman until the Great Depression. He was a partner in a business that
manufactured women&#8217;s coats and suits and he was the one who went on the road.
He traveled from store to store, mainly in the south. During the Depression,
the business could not support the two partners, my father and my Uncle Hyman,
so my father opened a retail store. My mother helped run the store while caring
for the house and the children. I graduated from Mt. Vernon High School when I
was fifteen-and- a-half. My mother gave me a choice of going to college or work
so I decided to go to college for a while. I went to an extension program of the
City College of New York in Yonkers. I was not really into college, I wasn&#8217;t
studying, so I dropped out after two years and went to work. I did sales work
at various stores, including a five and ten and became active in union
activities. I did volunteer work in the office for District Council 65, went to
meetings and gave out leaflets. It was an active union and progressive. We
opposed Hitler and supported the Spanish Republic. We also pressed the United
States government to provide support for the unemployed and pushed for union
recognition.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-align: justify;">Eventually I went back to
college at night and about the same time I was introduced to my future husband,
Ed. A friend had intended to introduce me to Ed&#8217;s older brother, Hy, who was
also a political person. The brothers lived together, but Hy was not home. This
must have been when I was twenty. Ed was a furrier&#8217;s apprentice but was let go
when he finished his apprenticeship. My father got him a job as an errand boy
for a button factory but he lost the job when they sent him to make a delivery
at a factory that was on strike and he refused to cross the picket line. Then
he went to work in new war-related industries until he was drafted. He really
hated doing defense work because most of the factories were paid cost-plus.
That meant that if they hired more workers, they made more profit, even if the
worker wasn&#8217;t really working. He was once told to find an inconspicuous place
in the plant and take nap! We lived first on the Lower East Side in Manhattan
and then moved to the Bronx. Ed initially had a military deferment because we
had two children, but eventually he was drafted. I went back to work part-time.
Ed&#8217;s younger sister lived with us and helped with the children so I could go to
work. A little later I put the children in a nursery and worked full time.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in;"><span style="color: black;">When Ed was sixteen he had worked on a poultry farm in
Massachusetts and he decided that was what he wanted to do with his life. He
was always a nature lover. From the beginning of our relationship he told me
that he did not want to stay in the city. After Ed came out of the army, with
my father&#8217;s help, we bought a poultry farm in South Jersey in Estelle Manor
about ten or twenty miles from Vineland. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.25in;"><span style="color: black;">We shopped for the farm through the Jewish Agricultural
Society which showed us farms that we could afford. We owned the first farm for
five years and then bought a piece of property with just a house and Ed built
chicken coops. We kept this farm until 1962.<br></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; color: black;"><v:shapetype id="_x0000_t75" coordsize="21600,21600" o:spt="75" o:preferrelative="t" path="m@4@5l@4@11@9@11@9@5xe" filled="f" stroked="f">

 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in;"><span style="color: black;">I was really a city girl and chicken farming was a lot of
 work. Though I got used to it, I never really liked it. We had a lot of
 friends in the area and were involved in the Farmer&#8217;s Union so it was not too
 bad. Poultry farming is more like a business than other types of farming. We
 got up early in the morning, maybe six o&#8217;clock, and Ed went out to feed the
 chickens and collect the eggs. The process took a couple of hours. After that
 there were all kinds of chores that had to be done -- cleaning the waterers,
 feeding and collecting eggs twice a day, vaccinating, debeaking, culling
 non-layers. There was always something to repair or make. Ed kept a small
 garden to grow flowers and fresh vegetables for the family.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in;"><span style="color: black;">After the afternoon collection, we used to clean the eggs,
 remove cracked and soft-shelled eggs, candle them, sort them for size, and
 pack them.. When we started working the farm we had to rub the eggs with a
 brush covered with sandpaper to clean them and used to hold the egg up to the
 light to make sure they hadn&#8217;t been fertilized and then we sorted them by
 size. Later we bought a motorized bucket that warmed and agitated water to
 wash a basket of eggs at a time in some kind of solution. We also bought a
 conveyor belt system on which the eggs would role past a light for candling,
 and then were sorted for size by a series of scales. The eggs were hand-fed
 onto the machine, but it was still a big improvement in labor. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in;"><span style="color: black;">I remember when my daughter Judi was about a year and a
 half old and we had just started on the farm she sat down in a basket of eggs
 breaking many of them. I was so mad I refused to change her for a while. When
 the children got older, about seven or eight, they used to help with the
 feeding of the chickens. Gradually we mechanized the farm so you didn&#8217;t have
 to carry the buckets from the feed bin but could roll them along a track. Like
 all farming, the poultry business could be very unprofitable. Chickens got
 sick or they stopped laying. The cost of raising laying hens was several times
 what the chicken-man would pay if we had to sell them for meat. Farmers had
 little control over the price of feed, which kept going up, even though we
 belonged to a feed coop. And we had no control over the price of eggs, which
 was high when the chickens weren&#8217;t laying and low when they were. When things
 were going bad you had to keep feeding the chickens even though you could not
 get a fair price for the eggs. It wasn&#8217;t worth it to sell them for meat
 because if the price of eggs went back up it would be too expensive to replace
 them. The Farmer&#8217;s Union tried to lobby the government for price controls or
 subsidies, but was unsuccessful. Larger farms that could mechanize
 sufficiently that they could take care of large numbers of hens were able to
 stay in business but the small farmers couldn&#8217;t make a living and started to
 go bankrupt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
 <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.25in;"><span style="color: black;">To keep the family afloat, I went to work in an office. We
 declared bankruptcy on the farm and Ed and I decided to go back to school to
 become teachers. While we got our degrees, we operated a soft ice cream stand
 where our three children all pitched in. Eventually I graduated from Rutgers
 and got a high school teaching job in Highland Park. Ed graduated from
 Glassboro State and became a middle school teacher in New Brunswick.</span></p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Times-Roman;">

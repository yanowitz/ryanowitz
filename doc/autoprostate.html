though
there is speculation that it has to do with diet. &nbsp;I wouldn't
be surprised if it also has to do with environmental pollutants,

&nbsp;I don't know anything about comparative rates of occurrence
from one country to another, or whether, like colon cancer (which IS
often related to diet), prostate

agricultural nations.</i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Two or three years before my
diagnosis of prostate cancer, I complained to my
GP in New York City that my sleep was being disturbed nightly by need
to
urinate. I had an enlarged prostate, he explained, common to men my age
(I
later learned that the prostate typically starts enlarging in one&#8217;s
30s), which
squeezes the urethra and makes it less tolerant about deferring
urination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Urinating
once or even twice a night, he
advised, was not unusual at my age (then 61 or 62), but it would be a
good idea to
start seeing
a urologist now for a baseline, and if the frequency of nightly
urination increased, to have my
prostate checked at once.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the
meantime, I should continue having regular PSAs,<a style="" href="autoprostate.html#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[1]</span></span></a>
which I think I had already begun at that point, to keep an eye out for
significant fluctuations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At that time I was splitting
homes between Manhattan and
Madison, Connecticut, on the Connecticut shoreline 20 minutes above New
Haven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because I
was spending more and
more time in Madison, I found a urologist there, and by a stroke of
luck picked
Thomas Martin out of the insurance list.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He has&nbsp;seen me through my troubles with
great skill and support.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Everything was fine for a
couple of years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
PSA scores were in the middle of the
normal range.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Though
the test was not
highly precise, in its 15 or so years of use it apparently has
revolutionized
the ability to detect prostate cancer early on.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="autoprostate.html#topofpage">Top

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;"><a name="The_drama_begins"></a>The
drama
begins<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In August, 2006, I felt I was
urinating more frequently in
the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Remembering
my NY GP&#8217;s
advice, I saw my urologist&#8217;s physician&#8217;s assistant, who doubted
anything was
wrong but had a PSA done just in case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Incidentally, the PA is a woman, and that is
noteworthy because her
fingers were much slimmer than those of any men who had examined me
over the
years, and hence the rectal exam was far less uncomfortable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An obvious point once
stated, but I had
never previously thought about it.)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The
PSA was a bit elevated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not
much, she
told me, barely above normal, but the percent increase was high enough
that&#8212;again just as a precaution&#8212;she would have Dr. Martin do a biopsy
on
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">His next available time was a
month away. &nbsp;The only prep I can remember is taking a fleet
enema
a short time before the procedure. &nbsp;My wife (who joined me
during
the procedure) and I
went in viewing this as a necessary waste of time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I couldn't see what was happening, but a tube was
inserted in my
anus, and through the tube the doctor passed a video camera and some
kind of
teensy snippers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
most painful part,
as he warned me, was when he anesthetized key nerves in the area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other than that, Martin
snipped off about a
dozen bits of my prostate from different places (he said the number
could be
anywhere up to two dozen) to send for biopsy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In
rare cases a patient can develop an infection (septicaemia) from a
prostate biopsy, but that is typically curable without much difficulty.
You get antibiotics to take before and after the biopsy, and if you
have any adverse symptoms like fever after the biopsy, you are
immediately to seek help. &nbsp;I had no after-effects, but my
brother-in-law, who had a biopsy in late January of 2008,did--and
refused to go to an emergency room for many hours. &nbsp; <a href="http://www.richardyanowitz.com/blog/?p=13#comment-70">He
ended up</a>
sedated and asleep, with numerous tubes and medications entering his
body, for over three days in an ICU and came within a whit of dying.
&nbsp;(He did recover.) &nbsp;This is EXTREMELY rare.</p>
<dl>
<dd><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">YANOWITZ'S RULE:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Read and follow your doctor's
instructions, dammit! &nbsp;If you're in doubt, follow the
instructions anyway--or at least <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CALL</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ASK</span>.</span></span></dd>
</dl>
<p class="MsoNormal">Within a week, Martin phoned me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;The bad news is, you have
prostate cancer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
good news is that if you have to have a
cancer, this is the least dangerous, your cancer seems minimal, and
we&#8217;ve
caught it very early.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>My
<a href="http://www.wmfurology.com/pcagleason.htm">Gleason
grade</a>
of 6 was typical, and the cancer appeared to be in only 20% of my
prostate. &nbsp;My prognosis was excellent. &nbsp;(It is
possible to
have a virulent level of prostate cancer that is incurable.
&nbsp;The doctor who founded Martin's practice, alas, died of
incurable prostate cancer several months after my own surgery.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I
give credit to
my NYC GP for having counseled me well so that I did not put off
seeking
evaluation when my frequency of urination increased.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">TROLL'S RULE:</span> </span><span style="font-style: italic; color: red; font-weight: bold;">Get
PSAs as directed--and if not directed, ask about them. &nbsp;No
excuses.</span></p>
<p class="stblcolhdr"><span style=""><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Given
Martin's reassurance, from that time I have felt diffident about my
cancer versus others' far worse and more dangerous ones and, until
recently, viewed this whole experience as little different from having
an appendectomy. &nbsp;I occasionally felt sorry for myself, but
for
the most part (so far as I remember) proceeded with my life with little
disruption. &nbsp;(Presumably each man will handle
the&nbsp;situation
in his own unique, equally legitimate way.) &nbsp;One of my more
conscious concerns was how much tennis I'd have to miss.</span></span></p>
<p class="stblcolhdr"><a href="autoprostate.html#topofpage">Top of page</a><span style=""><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span></span></p>

decisions</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now came some long
consultations while Martin, with amazing
patience and precision, carefully explained the situation and the
options for dealing
with
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since&nbsp;I
viewed this as a relationship decision, Maxine and I always went
together for such discussions; and as time passed, it was indeed
extremely helpful to have her join in wrestling with&nbsp;the
issues.
&nbsp;This visit took
an hour and a half. &nbsp;My first question (as seems to be true of
all men I've met who have had prostate cancer) was about how this would
affect me sexually. &nbsp;That depended on the treatment method we
chose, though I think we also learned that in any event I wouldn't be
likely to be sexually capable for a few months. (I will be saying more
about this.) &nbsp;At 64 I
was relatively young and
had a decent life expectancy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
a
method of planting radioactive seeds in the area of my groin, suitable
for men in their mid-70s and later, was not
recommended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
could choose to do
nothing and watch for changes (&#8220;watchful waiting&#8221;), but neither my wife
nor I
wanted to do that. &nbsp;Even with surgery, there was a small
chance the cancer could return after several years, perhaps in other
parts of the body. &nbsp;(Yes, you can have prostate cancer
anywhere; it's a kind of cancer normally but not necessarily located in
the prostate.) &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Two options lingered.<span style=""> </span>&nbsp;Dr.
Martin and a colleague, David Hess, had pioneered a robotic,
aka&nbsp;<a href="http://www.davincisurgery.com/index.aspx">Da
Vinci</a>, surgery in
Connecticut, and they had performed the surgery enough times (about 60
at that point) that it
was now
quite familiar to them.<span style="">&nbsp;</span>
This robotic surgery has been
used mostly for prostatectomies,
but had started to expand to other surgeries.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The surgeon sits at a console many feet away from
you and manipulates
fine tools in and out of your body.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Five holes maybe an inch each in diameter are
drilled in your lower abdomen:
in two holes go robotic arms, in a third a camera; a 4th allows
inserting and removing a bag into which the prostate is placed, and the

<p class="MsoNormal">Before Maxine and I decided,
Dr. Martin
insisted, we should see a radiation specialist,&nbsp;Francis
Cardinale&nbsp;<a style="" href="autoprostate.html#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[3]</span></span></a>
&nbsp;at
Saint Raphael's Hospital, about&nbsp;a recently improved radiation
therapy (<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/imrt/howitworks.html">IMRT</a>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The area around my
prostate would be
carefully mapped, and then I&#8217;d spend 9 weeks going almost daily for
radiation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Less
painful than surgery,&nbsp;it left a cooked prostate in your body
with a minimal, almost certainly not dangerous, residue of prostate
cancer cells. &nbsp;You ran a risk of some unpleasant side effects
(notably painful urination).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
could also damage nearby organs, though the IMRT beam is
touted for its tight, precise placement. &nbsp;After visiting with
the radiation specialist, I sought further clarification, and we had <a href="autoimrtemail.html">an e-mail exchange</a>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After meeting again with Dr.
Martin, Maxine and I chose <span style="">the robotic
surgery. &nbsp;By using that option
now, IMRT would still be available should the cancer return, but not
vice-versa; if radiation comes first, the prostate is so damaged that
only the old-fashioned surgery, cutting you open, is possible.
&nbsp;(This surgery needs blood transfusions in 30% of cases and
takes&nbsp;weeks for recovery.) &nbsp;Robotic surgery meant
we&nbsp; would have the prostate out and biopsied (the original
biopsy might be wrong, and we wanted to know exactly how bad my cancer
was). We would know if the prostate margins were clean (if so, the
chances of recurrence are less). &nbsp;The recovery period is
relatively short, and side effects are pretty uncommon (remember that
last statement as you read on).&nbsp;Chances of incontinence or one
form
of impotence or another are (supposedly) about the same with robotic or
radiation treatment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">At
that time, the biggest downside for me, in addition to missing tennis,
was having to wear a catheter for
at least a week after surgery. My only experience with one
had been after a colonoscopy, and it had been miserable. &nbsp;Dr.
Martin assured me he would make it tolerable.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><a name="noterealan"></a>NOTES</span>: &nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Since
my&nbsp;procedure, I have found, based only on anecdotal evidence,
that
urologists who do not practice the latest technology may try to push
their own favorite procedure and downplay others. &nbsp;Thus, for
example, I recently spoke with a urologist who was expecting to operate
on my brother-in-law if his biopsy was positive (it wasn't), and when I
mentioned my experience with robotic surgery he said he himself does
the old-fashioned surgery with a tiny incision and minimal
after-effects like impotence, whereas the robotic method requires five
holes in your body and.... &nbsp;I listened but recognized that
there
was no point in probing the issue with him. &nbsp;And he was
otherwise
a nice guy.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><span style="font-style: italic;">On
the other hand, I have also read that the surgeon's expertise is more
important than any specific method.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><span style="font-style: italic;">18
months after the surgery, Maxine and I continue to feel we made the
right best choice.</span></span></p>

<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><big>Because
the surgery would be in a Catholic hospital
(Saint Raphael&#8217;s in New Haven), I asked whether my medical care could
have
restrictions placed upon it where theology and medical practice clashed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer was no, and in
fact I would get&#8212;<i>had</i>
to get&#8212;a procedure&nbsp;not allowed in the hospital under any other

lead me

curious to notice when the chips are down what self-identifiers are

asked
me beforehand how I would feel about it, I probably would have shrugged

<p class="MsoNormal">I had to go through some tests
to make sure I didn&#8217;t have
cancer elsewhere in my body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
test was a
full body scan, which requires you to lie unmoving for what was
probably 20
minutes while a large overhead machine slowly travels the length of
your body,
head to foot, taking pictures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
don&#8217;t
remember what other testing was conducted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I also had to have a physical a few days before the
operation to make
sure I was in shape to undergo surgery.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My operation was scheduled for
October 24, my father&#8217;s birth
date (and, incidentally, the anniversary of the founding of the United
Nations); those who read any of my accounts of <a href="familydaddeathmycommentary.html">my relationship with
my father</a>, who died in 2003,
may wish to pause here and embark on psychoanalytical adventures
through the looking-glass.<span style=""> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I tried hard to take the
waiting period in stride.
&nbsp;I was largely successful, though I got depressed for a day
here
and there&#8212;quite normal, I&nbsp;expect. &nbsp;Given the
knowledge that our
sex life would probably be
interrupted for awhile, I think Maxine and I felt some pressure to
exploit
the remaining days before the operation&#8212;and pressure, of course,
usually only
makes it harder to relax and do whatever one is feeling pressured about.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I note this to help
normalize such an
experience for other couples, and to encourage couples to do their best
to stay mellow
in similar circumstances.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The day before the surgery I
had to do the same kind of
<a href="http://ibdcrohns.about.com/cs/diagnostictesting/a/colonoscopyprep.htm">bowel
cleaning required for a colonoscopy</a>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(In light of <a href="http://www.richardyanowitz.com/blog/?p=13#comment-70">my
brother-in-law's later near death</a> from an e-coli infection
after a prostate biopsy in
January, 2008,&nbsp;I now suspect the cleaning
is&nbsp;not because the surgeon
for some esoteric reason has to see into your bowels but rather to
minimize
any e-coli that might escape from a
punctured colon.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because
of some
evidence that the small bottles of the vile phospho-soda may have
drastically
bad effects in a few cases, Martin had me use the even more vile
Go-Litely (one of a few spellings), a nauseating one-gallon
water solution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
you&#8217;ve taken this,
you know it&#8217;s a&nbsp;process worthy of the Spanish Inquisition and
almost
enough to make you take your chances with cancer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even as I write these words the memory is making
nausea&nbsp;build in my throat.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I reached a point near the
bottom of the gallon
jug when I
knew I could drink no more without vomiting it back up. &nbsp;I
called
Martin's receptionist to ask whether, with the bottle so close to empty,
I needed to do anything further; I suspect she didn't relay my exact
question, and I ended up having to use the phospho-soda as well.
&nbsp;This was barely tolerable.</p>

<p class="stblcolhdr" style="page-break-after: auto;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-weight: normal;">As
part of hospital check-in procedures, I was asked for a list of all my
medications. &nbsp;(It wouldn't hurt to have a printed list, with
dosages, to hand over.) &nbsp;At the time, I thought this was to
check for chemical clashes with anesthetics or drugs I might be given.
&nbsp;After the operation, however, I decided the list was only to
know what medicine to give me <span style="font-style: italic;">after
</span>surgery, while I remained in the hospital.
&nbsp;I wished then I had only given essential medications--in my
case, anti-depressants.</span></p>
<p class="stblcolhdr" style="page-break-after: auto;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-weight: normal;">I
remember being wheeled into the operating room and&nbsp; near the
operating table&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-weight: normal;">seeing</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-weight: normal;">
(without
glasses) what (in blurred memory) resembled a gleaming metal box, maybe
hanging from the ceiling, half the size of a
washing machine, with metal tentacles hanging from it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I helped shift myself to the&nbsp;table and
nattered briefly
with an anesthesiologist without&nbsp;realizing I was losing
consciousness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="stblcolhdr" style="page-break-after: auto;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-weight: normal;"></span><span style="">Afterwards I learned
that the operation had gone well&#8212;in fact, taken an hour less than the
normal
six hours&#8212;and that my innards were well laid out so that Dr. Martin was
optimistic that he had avoided any important erection-related nerves,
though it
was impossible to be certain. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The first four of my five incisions
were stapled shut by the end of the surgery. &nbsp;(The fifth, you may arecall, was for drainage.)</span></p>
<p class="stblcolhdr" style="page-break-after: auto;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I
had had a whiplash injury five months earlier and a rotator cuff
problem before that, and Dr. Martin seemed to have
taken&nbsp;special
care for the well being of my neck and
shoulders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">When a
nurse asked before the surgery about such conditions</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">,
I didn&#8217;t understand my answers would help guide the operation.
&nbsp;Afterwards, the whiplash/arthritic pain was no worse than
before
and
probably better, while the rotator cuff, which routinely bothered me
before the
surgery, hardly hurt at all now.<span style="">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"></span></p>

the foot of the bed&#8212;that is, I don&#8217;t think I had to wake up alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knew Jason was driving
from Massachusetts,
and I was&nbsp;touched and gratified to see him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Since this was no more serious than an appendectomy, why make any
fuss over
me?&#8230;)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was in a
little pain, but while
allowed to push a button that would feed my body morphine (the device
automatically limited how much I could take over a given time), I
managed only
to need it three times during my 24-hour hospital stay. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

than in pain.</i><o:p></o:p></b></dd>
</dl>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I&nbsp;gradually came to understand that the five incisions were
pretty strong and I didn&#8217;t
have to worry I might damage them when I moved.&nbsp;</span><span style="">The catheter (called

for this I was quite grateful.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I did not yet, however, understand how it was held
in place&#8212;more on that
below.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">At
some point Jason drove home to Amherst.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By 9 or 10 that evening I took my third and last hit
of morphine and
then got out of bed for the first time and walked around the floor. I
did this at least once more before I went to
sleep, making the circuit multiple times and with little or no support
from the
nurse accompanying me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Though
I moved
slowly, I had little trouble walking.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(I had to wheel around a support for whatever fluid
was being conducted into
my body.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Late
afternoon or
early evening I started to feel hungry and was allowed to eat some
saltines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
probably took some ambien
to help me sleep, but I think I slept well.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Except
for: during the night, the other fellow in the semi-private room
started shouting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was in great pain and having trouble
responding to the nurse who came in; so she took the therapeutically famous measure
when someone, especially someone with hearing problems or (almost
synonymous) a
speaker of a foreign language</span><span style="">&#8212;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">neither

not to
understand us: she shouted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having
awakened to a semi-conscious stupor when the poor fellow started
shouting in
pain, I was now graced with the ongoing disturbance of the nurse&#8217;s
total oblivion to my
presence combined with her frustration that she couldn't soothe her
patient&#8217;s cries.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">While
I found my care generally good, the hospital
room to which I was moved was alienating, and I couldn&#8217;t wait to get
out of
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next
morning the drain was
removed (pulled out, with a little pain) from the rightmost of the five
holes bored in my
abdomen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the

releasing me too early.) &nbsp;The first&nbsp;lesson I learned
was that I had almost no energy reservoir.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">In a
requisitioned wheelchair that seemed to take forever to arrive (I think
a floor
nurse finally took pity on me and rustled one up outside normal
channels), I
was taken to the parking garage, where Maxine pulled up with the car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gingerly, I stood up from
the wheelchair and
edged sideways into the passenger seat ever so slowly, then, lifting my
legs
with my hands, rotated into sitting position.<span style="">&nbsp;

was to spend a week at home and then go to St. Raphael&#8217;s to test
whether the
bladder-urethra connection had regenerated enough to allow removal of
the
catheter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(During
surgery, the urethra
gets cut, then sewn back to the bladder; until the splice heals
completely, you
need the catheter to carry urine out of your body.)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If not, I&#8217;d wear the catheter a second week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During that first week I
experienced ongoing
tension between trying to be fatalistic about the need to wear the
catheter and&nbsp;desperately hoping it would be gone after the
week.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">To
deal with being bedridden for an indefinite period, people had given me
puzzle
books and paperback thrillers that required no thought.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I had also recorded on our digital video
recorder a number of (a) old favorites (like &#8220;The Lady Vanishes&#8221;) and
(b) crap
I liked as a kid (like Abbott and Costello movies) that now, at 64,
were just
about the right speed for my distracted brain.<span style="">&nbsp;

that was wishful
thinking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">During
the next week, I lay in bed a great deal&#8212;less each day,&#8212;occasionally
got up to
walk around (I was supposed to exercise), took some phone calls (which
in the
first few days exhausted me within 30 seconds, though it can be hard to
cut off
well-wishing family and friends), tried to solve various kinds of
puzzles (but found my brain not yet up to it), read a
trashy thriller, watched the movies I had recorded.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was taking painkillers, one of the side effects of
which was
constipation, an ongoing problem in my life, now exacerbated by the
gradual
return to normal bowel movements.<span style="">&nbsp;

constipation gave me strong motivation to wean myself from the
painkillers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

being unable to ease your pain. &nbsp;It seemed to help both of us
when
I said to Maxine that she

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Note
that the left picture illustrates a bag that can be strapped to either
thigh
and requires frequent emptying, as opposed to an alternative, much
larger bag
that needs emptying far less often but cannot be attached to the body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Since
I had no interest in leaving the house
(which I may have done once), I ended up mostly using the larger bag,
which had
a plastic hook that I could catch on a thick plastic clothes hanger and
then
either drape the hanger over the knob of my night table or carry it in
one hand
when I walked around the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Note also
the fork at the base of the catheter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>DON'T MESS WITH THE DRAIN: when you go to the
doctor's office to have
the catheter removed, this drain will be opened to deflate the balloon
(shown
within the bladder in both drawings).<span style=""></span>
&nbsp;The other branch connects to the urine bag.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In this illustration (for
the attachable bag), the bag plugs
directly into the catheter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
larger
bag has a long tube (maybe 2-3&nbsp;feet) that comes out of the
bag and <i>then </i>attaches to the catheter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Both types of connection are quite snug; indeed, it
can be awkward to
remove the tube from the bag, and I learned to be careful not
inadvertently to
jerk the tube so that it chafed my penis.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">When
taking a shower, I found it helpful to detach the bag with its long
tube and let any
draining
urine from the catheter drip into the tub while I bathed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I would drape over a doorknob the hanger that held
the detached bag&#8212;and
I had to remember to coil the tube so that the open end was <i>above</i>
the
urine level in the bag (or else urine would flow onto the bathroom
floor).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
turning off the shower, I had to
remember to reattach the bag at once so that urine wouldn&#8217;t be dripping
into my
towel or anywhere else.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since
I
couldn't see well without my glasses&#8212;and since early on I had little
tolerance
for frustration&#8212;Maxine did this for me for the first day or two.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Getting
the tip of the penis comfortable required some experimentation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the wrong angles (which
were many), I
could feel it pulling, a sensation that ranged from uncomfortable to
painful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But at the
right angle I could
even forget it was there (except to the extent that I sought rigorously
to
maintain that angle&#8230;).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
bed I would find
a comfortable position that I would then hold for a long time&#8212;probably
an hour
or two at times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Walking
around, I
learned where to hold the hanger so that the tube draped comfortably
from my
penis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was
made easier for me once
I realized that I was most comfortable when wearing <span style="">no
clothing from the waist down (and having no draping upper garment that
could flick the tube around).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maxine
quickly became accustomed to seeing me wandering naked and carrying a
hanger
with a dangling plastic bag of yellow fluid.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">At
the top of the catheter (the part within the bladder) is a drainage
hole to
channel urine out of the bladder.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The
urine appeared to drain in a steady sporadic flow: in the external part
of the
tube I could see stretches of urine interrupted by stretches of air.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Emptying
either kind of bag requires dangling it over the toilet (you don&#8217;t have
to
detach the bag from the catheter) and opening a kind of stopcock at the
bottom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For a
couple of days or so
Maxine emptied the bags; but zealous to recapture a semblance of
normality, as
soon as I felt steady enough, I did it myself.<span style="">&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Learning
to sit on a toilet with the catheter was at first intimidating but
easy,
bemusing and disorienting (counter to lifelong training)&#8212;you guide your
penis
and its tubular extension <i>out of </i>the toilet.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the early days I lowered and raised myself very
tentatively, in part
fearful of bending the catheter in a way that would cause pain at the
tip of my
penis, in part just generally weak.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Right next to the toilet we have a sink counter that
I used for
leverage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">For
at least the first few days, I was pretty flatulent. &nbsp;Since
releasing gas (a not infrequent need)
could also
release fecal matter,&nbsp;I had to hobble as fast as possible over
and
over to
the toilet just in case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Often
nothing
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite
constipation, at
first I was terrified of pushing while on the toilet, and I tried to
relax and
let gravity do the work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
after a
couple of days I began to feel safe to bear down, and that often helped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The unpleasant pressure
persisted for at
least a couple of more days, but by the end of the week at home, I
think it was
gone.</span></p>

bladder consequences<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">For
a few days after coming home the urine bag was pink from blood mixed
with the
urine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Preparations
for my
convalescence had included buying a couple of plastic sheets maybe crib
size,
one of which I kept under my buttocks and thighs wherever I lay or sat
to catch
any blood or urine leakage that traveled on the outside surface of the
catheter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wasn&#8217;t
prepared for this
leakage, and when I saw pink liquid emerging from my penis around the
catheter,
I became alarmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
didn&#8217;t know if there
should be blood and feared<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it
was a sign
of a serious problem.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
had no image of
how the catheter was anchored in my bladder (only later did I learn
about the
water-filled
&#8220;balloon&#8221; that held the catheter in), and I was terrified that a sudden
movement
might yank it loose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
began to freak
out, which was contagious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
finally
called Martin&#8217;s office and were assured that the leakage was normal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Slowly, we calmed down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It
took me awhile to accept the fact of the leakage&#8212;I&#8217;m not brave, but I
have
learned to come to terms with much adverse, unavoidable reality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What really unnerved me
was that soon after
this I had an overwhelming urge to urinate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Wednesday night I could hardly sleep, and we phoned
the doctor&#8217;s office
first thing Thursday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
learned that I
was having &#8220;bladder spasms,&#8221; which the post-op information had listed
as a
possibility but which I expected to feel like muscle spasms, not a
clogged,
full bladder.<span style=""></span></span><a style="" href="autoprostate.html#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style=""><comment title="[if !supportFootnotes]" xmlns="http://disruptive-innovations.com/zoo/nvu"></comment>[4]<comment title="[endif]" xmlns="http://disruptive-innovations.com/zoo/nvu"></comment></span></span></a><a style="" href="autoprostate.html#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style=""><comment title="[endif]" xmlns="http://disruptive-innovations.com/zoo/nvu"></comment></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style=""> </span>&nbsp;I
was prescribed medication that took another 24 hours to kick in and
relieve (most of) the pressure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
did manage
to sleep some Thursday night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">During
that stretch of time I felt in a torture chamber, that it was all I
could do
not to break down and have to be put in a straitjacket or doped up: the
thought
of having to wait til Tuesday (at least) to remove the catheter was
unbearable,
and I tried to focus on getting through moment by moment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did watch a lot of crap
TV.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My cousin
Elena, with whom I have had
contact mainly via e-mail, has had MS for decades and has had a number
of
related operations over the years.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I
had always admired her fortitude, and now I found myself thinking about
her,
wondering how she stood the strain, knowing that what I was enduring
was
trivial in comparison.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still,
in the
end we are each prisoners in our own skins, but while such thoughts did
not
diminish my own pain, I like to think they helped me manage it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">On
Friday when I awoke, the pressure to urinate seemed largely gone, and I
perked
up a lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since
coming home, my moods
had swung up and down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
even
at the worst times with the urine pressure, pain probably as bad as any
I&#8217;ve
endured, I firmly believed I was healing&#8212;that I was physically
miserable but
that that was not indicative of my body&#8217;s healing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Once the pressure went away, I became much more
fatalistic about
what would happen&#8212;that even if, horror of horrors, I had to go a second
week with the catheter (I didn&#8217;t then know it was possible to have to
go many
weeks), I could manage it now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 0.5in;"><b style="color: red;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">RECOMMENDATION</span></b><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: red;">: </span><i><span style="color: red;">Before you go home from the hospital,
ask for (demand) a
prescription for the drug that eases bladder spasms.&nbsp; Have
someone leave it at your pharmacy without being filled.&nbsp; If
you start to feel a desperate need to
pee, call the doctor&#8217;s office at once (don&#8217;t suffer overnight or
otherwise) to
confirm that&#8217;s what is going on, and if so call your pharmacy to have
the
prescription filled at once.&nbsp; Settle in
for some extended misery, but I suspect if you act promptly, you'll
feel better far sooner than I did.</span></i></span></b></p>

</span>Maxine would keep quizzing me and running errands to
groceries and
restaurants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
finally asked her to get
a variety of things&nbsp;that she knew I liked (mostly relatively
benign, unspicy
food) so that I could take my pick at a given moment without agonizing
(which
is what I was doing) about what to send her out for&#8212;and without having
to send
her out so often.</span></p>

a few days at home I was getting stir crazy, so <span style=""></span>
I put on just enough clothes to walk

</span>I realized I was now lying in bed most of the time
(other than</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">

walking around the house for exercise) mainly because I was
post-surgery and therefore &#8220;ill&#8221;&#8212;and I
realized finally that at the very least sitting up would feel good
(though it was hard to find
places where I felt comfortable&#8212;a barcalounger was one good location).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also found myself
getting sick of watching <span style="font-style: italic;">any</span>
TV, and sat where I couldn't see a TV but would have to read (something
light&#8212;I&#8217;ve always been partial to mysteries); this was a great help.</span></p>

week in:
off to test the catheter</span></b><br>
<p class="stblpara">The
visit to St. Raphael's one week after surgery was nerve-wracking.
&nbsp;My understanding was that I had a good chance of passing the
catheter test (a <span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><a href="https://www.asrt.org/content/ThePublic/AboutRadiologicProcedures/Cystogram.aspx">cystogram</a>)</span>,
but also a reasonable chance of failing and having to try again in a
week; and I could hardly bear the thought of retaining the catheter for
that week. &nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt;">Before
and during the procedure I asked questions and learned that for the
medical
people doing my test, it was highly unusual for someone to pass the
first time, so my expectations (and optimism) were lowered even as I
was about to undergo the procedure..<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;"></span>
<p>The "test"&nbsp;involves lying
on your back on a table over which is mounted x-ray or other equipment
for watching your innards. &nbsp;The urine bag is unplugged, and
distilled water is poured into the open end of the catheter gradually
to fill the
bladder while medical personnel watch an image of the bladder-urethra
area for leaks. &nbsp;As the bladder gets full, you begin to
experience
pain, and you're asked to let the medical folks know when it gets too
bad. &nbsp;Since I had the notion in my head that the longer I
could
stand it, the more likely I was to pass the test, I bore the pain
probably longer than I needed. &nbsp;Indeed, it may be that the
medical
people decided to stop adding water before I said anything; I can't
remember.</p>
<p class="stblpara"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">No
leakage was spotted between the bladder and the catheter!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was given the go-ahead
to proceed to the
urology office and have the catheter removed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On my way to the office, I met Maxine, and I started
to cry; I think I&nbsp;muttered, or at least thought, &#8220;It&#8217;s over!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I must have felt that with
the catheter in, my fate was still up
in the air, but that now I was about to be a real human being again
with a life before me. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">I
later learned that you could go many weeks without passing the test; my
friend
who had the same surgery several weeks after me had to wear his
catheter for
six weeks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I still
can't imagine how he stood it.<span style="">&nbsp; T</span>elling
me about his
experience (we have compared notes on everything&#8212;and I mean <i>everything</i>),
he reported that the catheter became pretty gross after awhile.</span></p>
<p class="stblpara"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">At the urology office, the PA who would remove my&nbsp;catheter </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">first took us to a computer to show us images of the cystogram.<span style=""></span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Then he read us the details of the
pathology report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He seemed to know
exactly what he was doing when he dealt with my body, including removal of
staples and the catheter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">He released the
valve
that would empty the balloon inside the bladder, then warned me I would
feel some pain, and almost at once, taking a few seconds, pulled out
the catheter, hand over
hand. <span style="">&nbsp; </span>Though brief, it was painful. &nbsp;As I will
relate, I was to have catheters a
few more times in the coming months, and I learned that depending on
how removal was
done it could be more or less painful.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Removal of my several staples, one at a time, also hurt, and the PA was
unsympathetic, comparing me unfavorably to his 10-year-old (or so) son
who clearly stood his pain like a man. &nbsp;I didn't care about
the
PA's judgment other than to want a level of sympathy that would produce
greater gentleness as he removed the staples. &nbsp;One
pain-management
technique I use is to shout when I feel the pain. &nbsp;(I have
explained this in advance at times to doctors to tell them to ignore my
shouts and proceed with what they're doing.) &nbsp;I don't think
this
PA appreciated my technique.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">I'm
not sure if it was this or a later occasion, but when the PA removed
the catheter I had blood in the tip of my penis, and I tried to blot
it&nbsp;with cotton that was at hand. &nbsp;I showed it to Maxine, and
we
both watched in some fascination as I dabbed at the blood. &nbsp;The PA
didn't like
this,
either ("put it away!" was his comment, I think)--it probably looked
too sexual or flamoyant, reactions that
surprise me from someone supposedly well trained in and experienced
with urology problems and their effects on patients.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">The
PA seemed to think that some of my questions were geared
toward&nbsp;&#8220;tricking&#8221; him into giving me permission to do
inappropriate things (whereas in my
perhaps pedantic way I was actually trying to avoid damaging myself by
being
very clear about timing for what I should or shouldn't do).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps
my questions came across as
challenging or critical of him. &nbsp;In any event, he went by the book
and told me not&nbsp;to consider doing anything energetic, including
being sexual, </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">until my next appointment 4 weeks hence</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">When
I asked what to expect in the way of erections and having sex, his main
response was &#8220;no intercourse&#8221; for the same period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I would have liked to understand, for
example, whether that was because the strain of love-making is intrinsically
bad for healing or because my urinary/genital system was not sufficiently fit
yet for orgasm) </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span>During
the same visit to have my catheter removed, I asked the PA how long I
should wait to return to normal life activities, notably tennis. He
seemed appalled I asked and told me at least a month.</p>
<p>Once
home without a catheter, both my spirits and energy&nbsp;lifted.
&nbsp;After a couple of&nbsp;days of walking and otherwise
taking it
easy, I decided to experiment with energetic movement.
&nbsp;I chose to take a quick step or two forward to see what
happened.
&nbsp;No pain. &nbsp;OK, I thought, I'll start jogging in a
circle in
the house, slowly, and if I feel even a twinge of pain, I'll stop.
&nbsp;I started jogging. &nbsp;No pain. &nbsp;I moved
faster. &nbsp;No
pain. &nbsp;Soon I was running as fast as I could in a tight circle
through a few rooms.</p>
<p>When Maxine came home later, I told her not
to worry at what I was going to do, and I showed her. &nbsp;I think
her
heart had a moment of weakness, but she seemed to accept that what I
was doing was not hurting me.</p>
<p>I phoned Dr. Martin and told him
what I'd done. &nbsp;He said that I could return to normal activity
as
fast as I wanted but to listen to my body and, if I became
uncomfortable, to stop.</p>
<p>It was probably the next day that I went
to the gym for a senior basketball game. &nbsp;My expectation was
to
try a&nbsp;few shots, dribble a little, and likely go home.
&nbsp;But I
felt OK as I warmed up, so I started playing. &nbsp;I was conscious
of
not overdoing the energy needed, but I was able to play and half-run
for some time. &nbsp;The following Monday I returned to tennis.
&nbsp;That is, within two weeks of the surgery I was back to full
use
of my body. &nbsp;This may have been a little fast, but I doubt it.
&nbsp;I tend to heal well, I had been taking care of myself, the
robotic surgery was supposed to minimize time of being laid up, and
while I expect some guys need a longer recovery period, the shorter
period is probably not uncommon. &nbsp;In any event, it worked for
me.
&nbsp;I was thrilled.</p>
<p>Somewhere
in these first couple of weeks after surgery I received a pathology
report: the prostate was successfully and fully removed with no
indication of cancer at the margins. &nbsp;As predicted, about 20%
of
the prostate was cancerous. &nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">I
was cancer-free and needed no further
treatment other than routine PSAs and checkups (every 3 months the
first year, every 6 months the second, and then annually).</span></p>

only incontinence occurred when I sat on the toilet, a minimal
inconvenience.<span style="">&nbsp;
After that, now and then I would leak a few drops of urine, most
notably when I
relaxed and the urine sneaked out before my muscles could adjust.
&nbsp;I wore pads in my underwear for a week or two; one of the
pre-surgery purchases was jockey briefs to hold the pads. &nbsp;(I
normally wear boxer shorts.) But the leakage was so minimal that
I soon preferred to live with it in my underwear now and again rather
than steadily wear&nbsp;a pad; it is intriguing what we can get
used to
that we never imagined possible. &nbsp;As I had been warned, when
playing tennis I occasionally had some leakage, typically when relaxing
after a vigorous point. &nbsp;Such incontinence has continued, very
rarely (once a week? once a month?), at least until the last month or
so.</span></span></p>

blockage</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span style=""></span></span>10
weeks after surgery, I starting having trouble urinating. &nbsp;The
stream became weaker and weaker, until it was just a few drops.
&nbsp;On January 3, 2007, I e-mailed Martin about the problem and he
told me to see him in his office that day or the next. &nbsp;The next
day I awoke quite uncomfortable and phoned his New Haven office.
&nbsp;"Drink lots of water," the
receptionist&nbsp;told
me, and if I was still troubled later in the day, I should call back.</p>
<p>I
wasn't entirely convinced that filling my bladder was such a good idea
when I couldn't empty it, but I figured the receptionist must know what
he was talking about. &nbsp;No: I could hear in his voice he was
guessing, but I felt reluctant to challenge him, and I probably didn't
believe I could have a genuine emergency. &nbsp;Whenever something
has
gone wrong since the surgery, I've had vague guilt that somehow it was
my fault.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><b style="color: red;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;">YANOWITZ'S (new) RULE:</span></b><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="color: red;"> </span><i><span style="color: red;">When in doubt, don't follow advice from
a non-medical person. &nbsp;Ask to speak to your doctor..</span></i></span></b></p>
<p>But
a few hours later, I had to cut short some volunteer work and dash to
the urology center, near where I was volunteering. Dr. Martin
tried to put a cystoscope down my urinary tract to&nbsp;identify
(and
fix) the problem, but I couldn't hold still and was in great pain.
&nbsp;I probably had a bladder scan, which would have shown the bladder
was stuffed with urine. &nbsp;Martin ordered an emergency procedure in
the hospital.
&nbsp;By
now I was in pain similar in intensity to what I had experienced with
bladder spasms a couple of days after surgery. &nbsp;(Drinking more
water had, of course, only exacerbated my problem.) &nbsp;</p>
<p>The
hospital still had to put me through all the admission procedure and
precautionary testing
prior to surgery. &nbsp;All this took time. &nbsp;At one
point when I was getting tests in a hospital room, Maxine and the nurse
running the tests got to chatting, and I
managed to squeeze out, in a loud voice (thank goodness for learning to
project as an actor), "No talk! &nbsp;Action!" &nbsp;They were
startled, but shifted focus. &nbsp;Every second
seemed excuricating. &nbsp;I had been given injections of morphine,
but
they didn't seem to be helping. &nbsp;Eventually I was taken to
a hallway outside the ORs, where I had to wait for relevant medical
personnel, including Martin, to gather.</p>
<p>While waiting, I got off
my gurney and went into the bathroom, sat on the toilet, and to my
surprise managed to squeeze out a few drops of urine. &nbsp;What a
transformation! &nbsp;Such a tiny amount would not, I'd have
thought,
be able to relieve me; but it did. &nbsp;I wasn't even certain I
still
needed the surgery.</p>
<p>I returned to the hallway where Maxine and one doctor
were waiting. &nbsp;At
this point, I began to feel manic, asking many questions, expressing
myself loudly and energetically, hardly able to stop talking.
&nbsp;Apparently this was a reaction to the morphine. &nbsp;It
was
probably another half-hour before the simple surgical procedure took
place.<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"></span></p>
<p>I
awoke with another damned catheter in me. &nbsp;This would stay in
just
four days, and I would need not pass a test prior to its removal.
&nbsp;It was demoralizing having to return to using the catheter;
on
the other hand, by now it was familiar. &nbsp;Because I was still
so
close to surgery, the innards around my urethra, especially near the
bladder, were hard to decipher, but Martin was hopeful he had solved
the problem.&nbsp; (The catheter removal this time, I should note,
was
done by a nurse who talked me through the process, removed the catheter
quickly but smoothly, not yanking at it, and, while inevitably causing
me some pain, hurt me much less than the first removal.)</p>
<p>Dr.
Martin explained that what had happened was highly unusual, occurring
in maybe 1-2% of post-operative recoveries. &nbsp;(Such low odds
would
not have deterred me from having the robotic surgery.) &nbsp;The
surgery left scar tissue at the base of my urethra. &nbsp;In most
cases, this tissue caused no problem, but in mine, as it hardened it
curled up (so to speak) and squeezed the urethra. &nbsp;He likened
it
to any scar tissue you get on your body while healing from, say, an
insect bite: as healing proceeds, the scar hardens and contracts.
&nbsp;Close to the time of falling off, it looks quite curled up,
but
on the surface of the body this causes no problem (unless you pick at
it and re-expose the still-healing wound...).</p>
<p>For the next couple of weeks after the catheter was
removed, I felt in fine shape. &nbsp;Then
my stream began to diminish again. &nbsp;Maxine and I had booked a
week
at a Mexican resort for early February. &nbsp;We were both by now
despearate for the break, and I could not bear the thought of having to
cancel the trip. &nbsp;So like any mature person in denial, I said
nothing to Maxine. &nbsp;Of course, while we were in Mexico I had
to
pee frequently and could do so only with difficulty. &nbsp;I
learned to
let gravity help, leaning over a urinal at an angle, my hands propped
against the wall, so that my bladder and penis would be fairly poised
above the urinal. &nbsp;Drops would leak down. &nbsp;Squeezing
the
muscles in the area would also elicit a few drops.</p>
<p>More than I,
Maxine was worried and could not always relax, even though I assured
her (as I believed was true) that I was going to get through the week
OK and could enjoy myself other than the dashes to the men's room.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I phoned Martin, who faxed a
prescription for a drug that might ease my blocked bladder.
&nbsp;(Turned out I didn't need the script--the pharmacist just
gave me
what I asked for.) &nbsp;I don't think these pills helped.
&nbsp;In my
mind I formed a plan that in an emergency, we would contact a Miami
heart surgeon with whom we had traveled in Costa Rica and ask him to
arrange for a urologist and operating room while we took the next
flight to Miami. &nbsp;This never became necessary. &nbsp;But
Martin's
office had faxed a medical excuse to show an airline if we had to make
an emergency flight. &nbsp;We still enjoyed much of the vacation,
but
much less than had I been problem-free.</p>
<p>Back in Madison...almost.
&nbsp;From our NYC studio apartment I made an appointment to see
Martin
a day after we got back. &nbsp;We boarded the MTA train to New
Haven
and were over halfway there when Maxine got a phone call from her elder
daughter that Karen, her younger (and pregnant) daughter, had collapsed
in the
street outside her gynecologist's office, had to be rushed to Mt. Sinai
(the nearest hospital) and would have emergency surgery. &nbsp;It
was hard to
tell how much blood she'd lost or what the prognosis was.
&nbsp;Since
our train was not far from where we had left our car, I got Maxine to
agree to proceed to the car (instead of getting off at the next station
and taking a train back to the City) as the fastest and most flexible
way to manage the situation. &nbsp;Poor Maxine was torn between
worrying whether her husband would be ok and whether her daughter would
live. &nbsp;(She did, though she had emergency surgery.)</p>
<p>The next
day we agreed I should return to Madison and keep my urology
appointment, &nbsp;Dr. Martin determined that he had to repeat the
original procedure but that since I WAS still squeezing out urine, it
should wait a day so that I could be treated at St. Raphael's rather
than the Madison office. &nbsp;Maxine stayed in NYC that day,
Wednesday, and then came to Madison to care for me after my procedure.
&nbsp;This must have been a terrible time for her, for many
reasons.
&nbsp;(Martin, who lives in Madison, had graciously offered to
drive me
to the hospital if Maxine had to stay in NYC.)</p>
<p>This time Martin could see the area of blockage much
more clearly and thought he successfully cleared it. &nbsp;Again, a
catheter for a few days. &nbsp;But within
weeks, the urine stream diminished again.
&nbsp;On March 27, I e-mailed him:&nbsp;</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">My urine
stream seems to have been slowly tapering. &nbsp;It still has an arc and
doesn't just collapse or dribble, but the arc is noticeably weaker than
a few weeks ago. &nbsp;The need to pee comes on with some urgency.</span><br style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">I have been
putting off writing you about this because I desperately don't want to
believe I need another procedure (aka denial), and anyway it hasn't yet
felt like an emergency. &nbsp;I pee for an extended time (which suggests the
bladder is emptying fine), and I feel as though there is slight
blockage--that is, instead of coming out in a relative torrent (isn't
that the norm? hard to remember...) it comes out as a slow stream (and
certainly slower than when I last saw you), with some pressure inside
my urethra, as if the urethra is constricting the flow.</span></div>



<div style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace; margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I have also
in recent weeks become slightly incontinent--just a drop or two, but
probably a couple of times a day on average. &nbsp;In the first weeks after
the most recent procedure (early Feb.) I seemed to have virtually no
incontinence.</span>&nbsp;</div>
<div style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace; margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Please tell me this is all normal and I shouldn't worry...</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><br></span></div><p>He replied that I should make an appointment for the following week. &nbsp;But later that day I wrote him:</p><p style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace; margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In fact, the stream seems to be getting
noticeably worse, so I guess I should see you. &nbsp;I will be going to NYC
Monday afternoon and returning Tues--but Tues, as I recall, is when you
do surgeries. So should I make an appointment for next Wed. morning in
Madison? &nbsp;(I assume it's too late to see you tomorrow morning in
Madison.)</span></p><p>So
he had me come to his office in New Haven the next day. &nbsp;We
planned a third procedure in the next few days, and Martin gave
me two options for follow-up care: self-catheterization (also called
"intermittent" catheterization) for 2-3 months, starting right away, or
laser surgery if the blockage recurred.&nbsp; In fact, he gave me
no
choice. He sensed I would choose the seemingly easy,
technological
option, and he&nbsp;insisted I&nbsp;try the
self-catheterization first
because it was less risky.</p><p>The
next procedure went fine, and once the catheter was out (a few days) I
went to Martin's office so his PA could train me in
self-catheterization.</p>

<p>Let
me assure you that I never dreamed I could (or would need to) perform
such a process. &nbsp;The idea terrified me. &nbsp;It turned
out to be
a piece of cake.</p>
<p>I've looked on the web for relevant information
and illustrations but could find content only about
self-catheterization for chronic problems in people unable to urinate.
In my case, the procedure was temporary--might last three months, I was
told, though I actually finished in less time--and was just once a day
rather than frequently through the day. &nbsp;I was working not
against
blockage&nbsp;(I could urinate fine after the third surgical
procedure)
but rather to "train" the scar tissue to stay in place and not curl up
again. &nbsp;I would do the&nbsp;self-catheterization once
every
morning for several weeks, then every other day, eventually once a
week, and then not at all. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Spoiler alert: this worked.
&nbsp;Within two months or a little more, I stopped
self-catheterizing,
and I have had no problem since (more than a year).</p>
<p>Keeping&nbsp;in
mind that the following semi-random web discussions are not entirely
relevant to my experience, you might find them useful--though again, it
is highly unlikely that anyone reading about my experience will ever
have the bladder blockage I did. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Here's
what I can remember a year later of what I&nbsp;did.
&nbsp;Martin's
PA trained me at the office with Maxine watching. &nbsp;A catheter
is a
couple of feet long, with a hole at one end (to receive draining urine)
and an outlet at the other end. &nbsp;There are various
thicknesses;
you get the one that is slightly thinner than your urethra. Bought in
bulk (say, 50 at a time), they cost roughly $1 each if you search
around the web a bit (your urologist or his or her assistant can likely
recommend
a site). &nbsp;While you can clean and re-use these,&nbsp;it is
inadvisable unless cost&nbsp;is important to you: you raise the
risk of
getting a urinary tract infection. &nbsp;Here's a photo of one
(color and exact shape vary among manufacturers, as does price):</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"><img style="width: 374px; height: 374px;" alt="" src="intermittent_catheter2.jpg"></span></b><br>
<b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></b></div>
<b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></b>
<p>A PA trained me in Martin's Madison office, and he was
great--patient and encouraging. &nbsp;Here's what you do (all in
your bathroom):</p>
<ul>
<li>Scrub your hands twice with a special sterilizing
liquid soap and dry with a (theoretically) sterile paper towel.
&nbsp;</li>
<li>Open a sterile gauze pad (I ordered a supply with the
catheters),&nbsp;lay the open wrapper, inside (in principle still
sterile) facing up, on a surface such as a counter next to the sink.</li>
<li>Lay the gauze pad on the open wrapper.</li>
<li>Squeeze&nbsp;sterile
lubricant from a tube (also purchased with the catheters) onto the
sterile surface of the gauze pad on the counter. (You'll probably need
to hold
down a corner with a sterile finger.)</li>
<li>Remove
the catheter at least several inches (or all the way) from its sterile
wrapper and pinch it several inches from the smaller end, making sure
the length that
will fit in the urethra touches nothing other than your fingers (if it
does, throw it out and open a new one).</li>
<li>Trying not to touch the sterile surface of the gauze
pad, pick it up&nbsp;and&nbsp;smear
the smaller end of the catheter with the lubricant for maybe 4-6
inches. &nbsp;This will ease the catheter down your urethra.</li>
<li>Stand over your toilet as if to urinate.</li>
<li>Holding
the catheter with thumb and forefinger (or more fingers if you need
to--your hands are sterile) of one hand above the lubricated part while
balancing the rest of the&nbsp;catheter (with the other hand if
necessary) so that it does not flop and so that the funnel-like end
points into the toilet, insert the lubricated end into the opening in
your penis, and slowly (you'll quickly learn the right speed) push the
catheter down, down, down. &nbsp;IT CANNOT GO IN THE WRONG PLACE (a
worrisome question in my mind before I did this).</li>
<li>You will feel it moving. &nbsp;It may be slightly
uncomfortable, but it is not painful.</li>
<li>When
it reaches the base of the urethra, it will encounter the sphincter.
&nbsp;You may need to push a little harder, and the sensation is
very
strange because (a) traversing the sphincter is a different sensation
from the preceding movement and (b) you're going to feel as if you're
about to pee involuntarily--and your&nbsp;instinct is likely to be
to
try not to. &nbsp;</li>
<li>As
soon as the tip of the catheter enters the bladder, urine will
pass through it&nbsp;&nbsp;into the toilet. &nbsp;This part of the process
quickly
became normal, though it always
felt a little strange to me. &nbsp;Since I had typically urinated
before performing the procedure (which I did as part of my morning
ablutions), very little urine actually splashed into the toilet--a
stream that lasted a second or less. &nbsp;(People who
self-catheterize
because they can't urinate at all perform this procedure several times
a day, and each time, of course, a full urine stream is likely to
emerge.) </li>
<li>Pause a few seconds and then pull the catheter out
(you'll quickly learn the right speed and technique).</li>
</ul>
<p>The very first time I did this, guided by the PA, I was
terrified of hurting myself.&nbsp; I
edged the catheter in what seemed a nanometer a second. &nbsp;It
may
have taken me 10 minutes to reach the sphincter. &nbsp;The PA was
totally patient, but Maxine started making fun of how slowly and
fearfully I was
proceeding. &nbsp;I reminded her "my body, myself," and she was
quiet.</p>
<p>When
I reached the sphincter, I didn't understand exactly what would happen.
&nbsp;The PA was holding some kind of large cup to catch urine, but
somehow I didn't control the open end (probably flopped it about in my
growing anxiety as I felt the need to urinate), and the urine splashed
on the floor. &nbsp;I felt embarrassed and apologetic, but the PA
behaved&nbsp;coolly about the whole thing and cleaned up the small
puddle.</p>
<p>As has been true for many new, intimidating experiences
in my life, once I had moved with extreme caution the first time and
had demystified the procedure, I was much more confident. &nbsp;I
was
much faster the next couple of times, at home, and soon was performing
the whole insertion and removal in maybe 10 seconds or less.
&nbsp;The preliminaries took much longer. &nbsp;During these ten or so weeks&nbsp;I had intermittent, slight incontinence.</p>
<p>After maybe five weeks, I
shifted to catheterizing ever other day, a week or two later every 3rd
day, then once a week for two or three weeks. &nbsp;Martin checked me
with a cystoscope, and&nbsp;I was done. &nbsp;During this time, and for
awhile after, I would monitor my urine stream as if I were peeing gold,
and from the next room Maxine would listen to the sound of the urine
hitting the water and comment as if she were a sportscaster narrating
an olympic event.</p>

<p>How many readers have skipped all the forgoing and
jumped here? &nbsp;I probably would have.
&nbsp;Impotence (more politely known as erectile dysfunction) is a
real but not inevitable and not untreatable consequence
of many prostatectomies, and I am still dealing with it as I write
almost two years after surgery. &nbsp;But I have had considerable
improvement. I knew nothing about the problem until I had to face it,
and I have found other men quite fascinated to learn about it; so I'm
going to describe my experience here frankly and in detail.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;"></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Two
physiological factors affect erections: muscles and nerves.
&nbsp;(The third key factor, as we all learn over a lifetime of
being sexually active,&nbsp;is psychology.) &nbsp;The prostate
is close to and enmeshed with many relevant nerves. &nbsp;There is
much talk these days of nerve-sparing surgery, and as I mentioned
earlier Dr. Martin thought he had avoided key nerves. &nbsp;But I
also understand that no surgeon can be absolutely certain which nerves
were or weren't affected. &nbsp;The nerves can regenerate over
time, but apparently quite slowly. &nbsp;Erection muscles, on the
other hand, when not used for an extended time, can atrophy, so that at
some point stimulating erections by some means becomes important,
preferably to reduce the chance of such atrophy, but in the worst case
to exercise the muscles and return them to normality. &nbsp;All men
normally get several erections while asleep; this stops with impotence,
and so exacerbates the potential for atrophy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">I
have heard varying statistics about impotence after prostatectomies,
and I suspect they were driven by what the predictors had seen in their
practices. &nbsp;My surgeon and internist both thought that a year
was likely to be the outside limit for returning to erections at least
through pills (viagra, levitra, /cialis), though in rare cases
this might extend to two years. &nbsp;A return to natural erections
was supposedly 40% or so; with pills another 50%. &nbsp;The
specialist I eventually saw had less optimistic results, and I suspect
this is because by the time patients see him, they have already had an
extended problem; his take was that the typical man would respond to
pills, but not until the two-year mark</span></p>
<p>For some months after surgery, it is unlikely you'll get
even a hint of an erection, though you'll likely be able to be erotically
aroused and achieve orgasm (admittedly with considerable effort).
&nbsp;In my case, I did have orgasms from time to time, but the
whole experience became alienating. &nbsp;My wife and I both had
feelings of hesitation, inadequacy, guilt--you name the dysfunctional
emotion, we had it. &nbsp;We would feel reluctant to try being
sexual, nervous and self-conscious during any such effort, and rushed
if we had any indication that I might be getting an erection.
&nbsp;All this uneasiness only helped create a self-fulfilling
prophecy. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The good news is that in the previous 11 years of our
relationship, she and I had worked hard at talking out any problems
between us, a skill often vital to overcome clashes between us, but no
more vital than now, when we weren't clashing but <span style="font-style: italic;">were </span>behaving
dysfunctionally around our sexuality. &nbsp;I&nbsp;have been
profoundly grateful for having a partner who has
been&nbsp;supportive, understanding and validating--sometimes too
much so: as she and I have discussed, she mustn't put her energy
into&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">taking
care of me</span> (a general and almost always bad habit), but
into both trusting me to take care of myself and being honest, with
herself as well as&nbsp;me, about her feelings.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">CRUCIAL:</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">If you have an intimate
relationship, view any impotence as a problem of BOTH partners; you
both, after all, have a vested interest in your sexual relationship,
which in turn is important to the intimacy in the rest of your
relationship. &nbsp;Talk about it and your feelings openly and
frankly. &nbsp;BOTH partners need to be honest about their feelings
and not yield to (natural) embarrassment or fear of upsetting the other
partner. &nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">If you have trouble talking
about such a delicate and often embarrassing subject, see a couples
counselor or therapist who specializes in impotence issues.
&nbsp;NOT TALKING will inevitably exacerbate the problem and
intensify alienation between the two of you. &nbsp;(If you already
have serious relationship problems and don't already have a couples
counselor, I suspect it will now become especially crucial that you
find one.)</span></span><span style="font-style: italic; color: red; font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
<p>During the second half-year after my surgery, I think I
had very slight erections when I took pills, but nothing useful, and by
the one-year mark I seemed nowhere close to recovery. &nbsp;At this
point Dr. Martin and I agreed that further steps were needed, and I
ended up seeing two specialists in the field. &nbsp;Martin&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">thought
that the extended problem with my bladder blockage may
have traumatized the erection muscles, but the specialists
were sceptical whether that experience mattered. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">To
put it mildly, I was very unhappy with the first specialist, whom I
shall call Dr. X out of deference to my own inability to be
detached&nbsp; about this experience. &nbsp;On my side, I will note
that
my wife, who has no problem criticizing me when she thinks I'm wrong,
felt similarly to me about him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Here
are the alternative treatments, aside from pills, of which I'm aware:
self-injection into the penis of erection-stimulating drugs, a vacuum
pump, and a penile implant, which is a last resort when nothing else
works and which my wife and I would have considered at some
indeterminate point of ongoing failure. &nbsp;(There's also some kind
of pellet you can insert through the penis opening, but my understanding is
that this option has more potential problems than the others.)</span></p>
<p>Here are some web discussions of these options (on
self-injection, I found primarily specialized journal articles, which I
have not included here):</p><div style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="http://www.urologychannel.com/erectiledysfunction/treatment.shtml">Explanation

I arrived, with Maxine, for my first meeting with Dr. X, he hadn't read
my history, but waved that aside as unimportant. &nbsp;(To be fair, my
next specialist, for different reasons, also hadn't read my chart but
didn't think that would hamper him.) &nbsp;He assured me he already
knew what I needed. &nbsp;He affected joviality and openness but in
fact had little patience for any questions he thought were challenging
him.&nbsp; (I seem to have a knack for making people feel threatened
when I'm just trying precisely to clarify information; it's the
demand for precision, I think, that annoys people.) &nbsp;He went over the general
issues and plan for treatment (probably informative, but I don't
remember), and made an appointment with me a few days later, without Maxine.</p><p>This
appointment was one of the more traumatic experiences of my
life--certainly of my post-prostatectomy life. &nbsp;X slowly walked
me through the procedure he was following, though I wasn't sure I'd
remember all the steps. As he filled a special syringe (it might have
been a <a href="https://richardyanowitz.com/Caverject%20http://www.webmd.com/erectile-dysfunction/alprostadil-treat-ed">caveract injection</a>),
he explained that depending on my response, the dosage might&nbsp;need
to be adjusted. &nbsp;I stood up, bare from the waist down, and he pointed
what&nbsp;seemed a verrrrry long needle parallel to the floor and halfway along the shaft of my penis, grabbed and
stretched the tip or the penis, and quickly jammed the needle all the
way through so that it came out the other side.
&nbsp;I felt&nbsp;like a&nbsp;sausage on a barbecue spit. &nbsp;I
think I yelped loudly and was terrified of budging. &nbsp;He told me to
push the plunger. &nbsp; Truly, I tried, but all strength seemed
drained from my body, and he finally did it himself. &nbsp;Then he
withdrew the needle, handed me a gauze pad to hold firmly around where
the needle penetrated, and left the room for five or more minutes. &nbsp;</p><p>I
sat, traumatized, squeezing the gauze and near tears. &nbsp;I did not
see how I could ever do this shot on my own. &nbsp;When X returned with
a packet of porno photos, I had the beginnings of (for me) an unusual
erection: preposterously&nbsp;fat and with a thick bulge, like a lion's mane, at the area
where my foreskin had been&nbsp;attached before my <span style="font-style: italic;">bris</span>.
&nbsp;He left me alone again. &nbsp;The porno did little for
me--alienating and almost clinical, especially in the atmosphere of an
examining room--but I managed to produce an orgasm, albeit of little
gratification. &nbsp;When he returned and we discussed the result, he
grew impatient with my follow-up questions and reminded me that he had
other patients. &nbsp;I suggested that if so, he should book longer
appointments.</p><p>When I next visited X, he expressed regret that he
had pushed me so quickly to try the injection. &nbsp;I told him I
didn't believe I could do it myself, and he arranged for me to meet a
pump salesman. &nbsp;</p>X,
I suspect, is the right doctor for many
men, who (I gather) often don't want to go into details about their
sexuality
and/or who want to be told what to do. &nbsp;When I said to him that it
would have helped me had he told&nbsp;me what to expect before giving
me my
shot, he said, "Most men don't want to know." &nbsp;I did not observe
that "most" means "not all," and that rather than use
one-size-fits-all in this context, he could ask each patient. &nbsp;I
suspect that had I known exactly what was going to happen, I would
still have been traumatized by the shot (because it was probably worse
than his description would have conveyed), but not as much.<p style="font-weight: bold;">October 4, 2008</p><span style="font-style: italic;">It
is taking me so long to publish all the details that (to make sure core
information is available for readers) I'll now summarize the last year
or so and fill in details later as I'm moved to do so.</span><br><p>Since
December, 2007, I have been seeing an impotence specialist at
Sloan-Kettering in New York City: John Mulhall. &nbsp;I have found him
wonderful to work with, though the handicap of a specialist with a
large practice is that I haven't gotten to talk with him directly as
often as I'd like. &nbsp;When I do, however, he is always patient and
thorough. &nbsp;For non-office visit care, I have dealt with a PA who
is highly knowledgable in general but (a) very by-the-book with little
apparent trust in any individual patient's ability to make independent
decisions and (b) not always on my wavelength about answering questions.</p><p>I
have been using injections of a different kind from what I experienced
with X. &nbsp;I use a diabetes syringe, which I insert at an angle
partway into my penis. &nbsp;With thoroughness (more than I needed,
actually, but I told myself to be patient) and a model foam-rubber
penis, the PA taught me how to self-inject. &nbsp;The experience is
never pleasant, but it is minimally painful. &nbsp;There are three
levels of potency of the drug you inject: trimix (3 chemicals), bimix
(2) and papaverine (one of the 3). &nbsp;After twice being priapic
(extended erection that requires an emergency visit for a
counter-injection) on the trimix and once on the bimix (in the office),
I moved to papaverine, a very weak solution. (The good news: you can't
be priapic unless your erection muscles are in good shape--the first
question to be answered.) &nbsp;About 6 months ago Viagra began to
work. &nbsp;However, since then both the papaverine and Viagra have had
mixed results. &nbsp;This is apparently a psychological problem.</p>Men
may joke about priapism (as I have), but it is no fun and, as the
impotence drug ads on TV warn, after 4 hours it can be
dangerous.&nbsp;The erection becomes uncomforable, I usually couldn't
urinate, and the visit to an emergency room (I went near my home in
Connecticut;&nbsp;if I lived in NYC, I'd have gone to Mulhall's office)
is a bit unnerving. &nbsp;Moreover, I had what may have been a
near-death experience the second time. &nbsp;In both cases, the on-call
urologist at Mulhall's office called the emergency room and smoothed
the way for my treatment (you can't sit several hours in a waiting
room--after 4 hours of priapism, you are at risk of permanent
damage--and the antidote is not easily available); Mulhall's office
gives you a card of instructions for emergency rooms because usually
they aren't familiar with what needs to be done. &nbsp;On the first
visit I was treated by a doctor who was kind of familiar with the
procedure--turns out it's not an uncommon side-effect of sickle-cell
anemia--and the experience was relatively benign (though it took an
hour for the erection to come down; at Mulhall's office it takes 5
minutes). &nbsp;<br><p>The second emergency room visit was a disaster.
&nbsp;Fortunately, before the shot I was hooked to a heart monitor,
because this doctor miscalculated (though she did the calculation
several times in her head) and gave me 10 times the proper dosage.
&nbsp;The medication (neosynephine) is used to counter cardiac arrest
(or maybe some less profound but very serious heart condition), and my
blood pressure shot way up while my body felt severely distressed.
&nbsp;I had to lie down and was given intravenous saline solution (I
think). &nbsp;I give the doctor credit: she came back afterwards,
having re-calculated the dosage on paper, and acknowledged that she had
miscalculated the dosage; andon the card I carried from Mulhall's office she wrote a note about the correct calculation. </p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">CRUCIAL:</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">I
made the huge mistake of not stopping her during the injection, or
maybe even before. &nbsp;Having done this once, I knew that she should
be using a small, diabetes syringe. &nbsp;She used a much larger one.
&nbsp;I also knew that the previous doctor had mixed the solution in
such a larger syringe and then decanted the correct dosage into the
small syringe (he joked about the fact that he would NOT be using the
scary-looking large syringe). &nbsp;And (since the previous doctor had
me inject myself), I knew the shot should be relatively quick.
&nbsp;This one took forever, and as I writhed in pain I asked whether
she could do it faster. &nbsp;"That would be dangerous," she explained
(correctly). &nbsp;AT THAT POINT I SHOULD HAVE HAD THE CONFIDENCE TO
SAY, "STOP!!!" and then discuss the previous process with her.</span></span></p><p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">YOU MUST HAVE THE ABILITY TO INTERVENE IN YOUR CARE. &nbsp;ASK QUESTIONS, AND IF YOU KNOW SOMETHING IS WRONG, EXPLAIN WHY. </span></span></p>After
these experiences, I returned to Mulhall's office. &nbsp;His PA tried
the bimix, which gave me priapism at the office, and I was sent home
with a papaverine prescription. <br><p>This
happened in early winter,
2008. &nbsp;At first the papaverine worked okay. &nbsp;Then, under
instructions to try Viagra from time to time, I found the pill working.
&nbsp;I immediately decided to stop injections. &nbsp;Viagra did
continue to work a few times (Cialis and Levitra had lesser effects for
me; each supposedly works differently for different men, though
Mulhall's experience is that Viagra works best for most men). But
thenit became problematic, and when, with a sense of defeat, I returned
to papaverine, it didn't do enough for me either. </p>What
does "working" mean? &nbsp;Erections are scaled 1 to 10 (1 worst).
&nbsp;Right after surgery, I had 1s. &nbsp;As time passed, before
injections, I might have moved to a 2 or 3. &nbsp;6 is rated as the
minimum hardness for penetration; 7-10 go up from there. &nbsp;I don't
think the drugs have gotten me past 8 (except when I became priapic),
but this was enough for reasonable gratification for both me and my
wife. &nbsp;(Neither of us thinks the drugs have reproduced what I
typically got before surgery.) &nbsp;<br><p>What began to happen after the papaverine worked a few times was that I would quickly lose whatever erection I had,
and sometimes wouldn't even get to a 6. &nbsp;But after orgasm I might
move to an 8 or even 9. &nbsp;The problem, Mulhall says, is adrenaline,
which counteracts the medications. &nbsp;And the more nervous and
self-conscious I get (so does my wife: we feed off each other), the
more adrenaline gets flowing. &nbsp;This becomes a vicious circle.</p><p>When
I returned to papaverine after Viagra and I continued to get inadequate
erections, my wife and I thought that perhaps the solution was out of
date. &nbsp;On a return visit to Mulhall's office a month or so ago, a
new problem was detected: <a href="autoprostate.html#peyronies">Peyronie's disease</a>.</p><p style="font-weight: bold;">November 18, 2008: Prostate cancer support group</p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I
would have loved to find a useful support group, but when I tried one
(at New Haven Hospital) sometime in my 2nd year post-surgery, I found
myself in significantly better shape than the&nbsp;five other men in
the group; of course, this may not be true for all such groups. In this
particular case, though, everyone was in such bad shape that when I
said I was there to talk about my impotence issues and that in all
other ways I was healthy,&nbsp; it was hard for anyone else to feel
sympathetic or supportive: at least a couple of men were wearing
diapers for the rest of their lives because of incontinence, another
would be dead with a year, and a couple of others had been struggling
for years with significant post-surgery side-effects. &nbsp;Indeed,
when I said that in the worst case I'd have to get an erection implant,
at least one reaction was an excited, "Well there you go! &nbsp;That's
your solution!" &nbsp;They all would have been happy to change places
with me.</span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I
understood what was happening and didn't feel hurt--rather felt a bit
of a fraud to be there (intellectually, I knew better), and wishing
them well, told them I would not return. &nbsp;(I cited a favorite
saying of my father's: "I wept because I had no shoes until I met a man
who had no feet." &nbsp;(I don't know the source, but it sounds like
something that would have arisen in the Great Depression.)&nbsp;</span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Despite my experience, I would urge other men to try out such support groups before writing them off.</span></p><p style="font-weight: bold;">November 12, 2008</p>I
had my 2nd-surgery-anniversary meeting today with&nbsp;Martin; my PSA
is still undetectable, and I won't see him for another year. &nbsp;He
still thinks the self-catheterization contributed to my impotence
problems--and what he explained today makes sense: the point at which I
had scar tissue is where my urethra was severed and then re-stitched to
the bladder. &nbsp;Around that area, close or clinging to it, are
erectile nerves. With frequent catheterization, the whole area kept
being disturbed, and the nerves were plausibly, if not definitively,
repeatedly traumatized.<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><p>I
will be getting a testosterone-level check. &nbsp;Low testosterone can
cause or contribute to a number of problems, including impotence (and
such things as sleep difficulty, memory loss, depression...).
&nbsp;There is some risk in having testosterone therapy, but thinking
over the last 20 years has tended to minimize that risk; the concern is
that testosterone may contribute to development or acceleration of
prostate cancer; this is why an extreme treatment is chemical
castration--and not too many decades back was literal castration.

&nbsp;</p><p>In recent days I have had the following thought vis-a-vis
post-prostatectomy erection issues: It may be that what is an
acceptable erection (say a 7 or 8) to some urologists is less
acceptable to patients. &nbsp;If so, my expectations of returning to
full erectile functioning post-prostatectomy were unrealistic. &nbsp;On
the other hand, my slow but relatively steady improvement may still
bode well for the future.</p><p><a href="autoprostate.html#topofpage">Top

is scarring inside the penis. &nbsp;Named after a 17th-century French
physician, it's exact &nbsp;cause is unknown, but Mulhall finds
correlation with post-radical prostatectomies. &nbsp;It can cause bad
pain for awhile (at
least several months) and curvature of erections that can get so severe
that intercourse is impossible and surgical repair is needed. &nbsp;</p>In
my case, I've had no pain (and, he tells me, am unlikely to have it--it
normally appears right away), and I have no unusual
erection&nbsp;curvature (though this could happen). &nbsp;My wife and I
think that girth of the erection is less than pre-surgery, and I may
have slight shortening (both common results of Peyronie's). &nbsp;An
ultrasound of my erection was done and showed no special problems
(e.g., with blood flow in or out of the erection--if it leaked out, it
would be a major problem).<br><p>So Mulhall continues to believe that
the problem is adrenaline. &nbsp;My wife and I will try some exercises
and we expect to visit an impotence specialist. &nbsp;Our problem is
apparently common between prostatectomy-less men and their partners. &nbsp;But much as we talk about
it honestly, we don't seem able to overcome the pscyhological impact.
&nbsp;(On her side, she is not helped by being post-menopausal and
taking Zoloft, which like other SRIs can damp down the libido.)</p><p>As we learn more, I'll record the information here.</p><b style=""><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial;"></span></b><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></span>

<p class="MsoCommentText" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">And recorded by the class&#8217; Book Pals reader, Richard
Yanowitz<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">You have probably heard a
tale about a girl named Dorothy who was blown by a tornado to the land of Oz,
where she experienced many adventures.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Well, I am here to tell you
what really happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much has been
hidden all these years because of nasty human prejudice against the most common
of all life forms&#8212;insects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">As you may have guessed, I am
myself an insect, and proud of it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, I am a member of the noblest race of insects of all (I&#8217;m sure
that our nobility is what makes humans especially hate us more than other insects):
the cockroach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My name is Cucaracha,
and I know what really happened to Dorothy because I was there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Now it&#8217;s true that these
events started out on a wheat farm in Kansas back in the American
Depression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it&#8217;s true that Dorothy,
a 15-year old girl, lived on the farm with her aunt and uncle and a few
farmhands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yes, Dorothy had a
little pet named Toto.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Toto used to follow Dorothy
on her two-mile walk to school, and sometimes he got into the schoolhouse and
sometimes even bit at the teacher, who was the meanest teacher in all of
Kansas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was so mean that she
decided to take Toto to the pound for trying to bite her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Thus it happened that one
late spring afternoon, the teacher rode her bicycle to Dorothy&#8217;s home, told
Dorothy&#8217;s aunt and uncle what Toto had done, and demanded to take Toto
away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I know this because Toto told
me; we haven&#8217;t gotten to where I come into the story&#8212;but be patient; we&#8217;ll get
there soon enough.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, it seemed
that the aunt and uncle felt they had no choice, since however mean a teacher
might be, you really can&#8217;t go around biting her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">So the teacher, who had a
pointy face and looked like a Hallowe&#8217;en creature, stuffed Toto into the wicker
basket on the back of her bicycle, latched the basket, and pedaled off.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dorothy, you can imagine, was
thunderstruck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She ran after the
bicycle, crying, &#8220;Toto!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Come back!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Toto!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But the teacher pedaled too fast, and Dorothy collapsed in an exhausted
heap.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Crying, she walked back to her
farmhouse.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Now Dorothy,&#8221; her uncle
said, &#8220;I know this is very upsetting to you, and I&#8217;m terribly sorry it&#8217;s
happening, but you&#8217;re going to have to accept it.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Yes,&#8221; echoed Dorothy&#8217;s
aunt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;This is the Depression, and
many, many people in America and the rest of the world are suffering far more
than we are.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You'll just have to be
brave.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">So Dorothy wiped her tears
and tried to be brave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(At least this
is what she later told Toto, who told it to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Oops!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I guess I just gave
away the fact that Toto will come back into the story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But you knew that already.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Forcing herself to do her chores, which she
should have started at least a half-hour earlier, she went to the farmhouse
kitchen to take out the garbage and carried it outside it to the pigs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just after she poured the garbage into their
trough, however, she got the surprise of her life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">This is where the story gets
interesting&#8212;because this is where I come in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Being a smart cockroach, I
had long since learned when Dorothy fed the pigs, and since I, too, love
garbage, I was waiting for my dinner&#8212;which had been delayed )as I later
learned) because of Dorothy&#8217;s thoughtless insistence on crying and moping about
instead of getting on with her chores when she should have.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Now normally I hid out when
it was time for Dorothy to arrive, because I had learned the hard way that
Dorothy loved cockroaches&#8212;loved to dissect them, that is.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She always had her dissecting kit with her,
elsewhere she went, and I had seen many of my friends caught and cut apart by
this wretched girl at pig feeding time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">This day, however, because my
dinner was late, I had become restless and careless, so that when Dorothy
finally appeared, I was totally visible.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And I was so scared that I couldn't move&#8212;scared stiff, I guess you could
say.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She didn&#8217;t see me for a few
moments as she poured the garbage into the trough, but before I could get into
hiding, she caught sight of me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And boy
did her mouth fall open!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">You see, I forgot to mention
one teeny detail: It happens that I am&#8212;and I say this with total lack of
pride&#8212;a huge cockroach, the largest ever.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In cockroach eyes, I&#8217;m a giant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, I have a little dance and song I made up about myself that
goes:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 49.5pt; page-break-after: avoid;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I&#8217;m Cucaracha, I&#8217;m Cucaracha,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 49.5pt; page-break-after: avoid;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Largest cockroach ever seen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 49.5pt; page-break-after: avoid;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I&#8217;m Cucaracha, I&#8217;m Cucaracha,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 49.5pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Come
look at me and then turn green.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The song gets better as it
goes along, but I should get back to my story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">As a result of being so big,
it is pretty hard to avoid being spotted, and I could see in Dorothy&#8217;s eyes
that she was imagining how she would cut me into little pieces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I saw her patting her pocket to reassure
herself that she had her dissection kit with her, and then she jumped toward me
and held out her hands as if to cup water in them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only when she was about to scoop me up did I recover my senses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I spread my wings and flew just out of her
grasp. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Still a little shaken, I could
only fly in circles, and two more times she lunged for me and almost snared me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">But then I managed to
straighten myself out, and I flew as fast as I could down the road away from
the farm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dorothy was running after me,
but when I looked back I could see she was losing ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Way up ahead I saw a bicycle with a basket
on the back, and before long I had caught up with it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I perched on the top of the basket for a moment, and then, to get
out of sight, wriggled through the gap beneath the top.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I flopped in a corner, closed my eyes and
breathed a huge sigh of relief.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I was about to doze off when
I felt something firm and cold and wet crawling all over me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What an icky feeling!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I opened my eyes, and you can imagine my
terror when I saw some giant animal opening its jaws, lined with giant, sharp
teeth, and getting ready to make a meal of me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Wait!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I cried, and the creature paused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;What are you doing, strange creature?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why do you want to eat me?&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It stepped back, eyed me suspiciously,
and said, &#8220;Because I&#8217;m hungry, of course.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It spoke so awkwardly&#8212;a kind of growling sound, if you know what I mean,
that managed to shape itself into words&#8212;that I could hardly understand it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been trapped in this basket, getting
hauled off to my doom, and I never even had my supper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And although you&#8217;re only a cockroach, you're
the biggest and juiciest cockroach I&#8217;ve ever seen by far, and I expect you'll
make some dent in my hunger when I swallow you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And by the way, I&#8217;m not a strange creature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m a dog, and my name is Toto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now please hold still; I don&#8217;t like my
dinner stirred up.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the &#8220;dog&#8221; put
its tongue out and pushed the tip in my direction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;But wait,&#8221; I shouted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;I might make a delicious meal, but I can be
even more use to you alive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m a magic
cockroach, and if you spare my life, I will grant you three wishes.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Magic cockroach?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Really?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I&#8217;ve never heard of one before.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Well you have now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Go ahead.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I&#8217;ll prove it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Make a wish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Except of course you can&#8217;t wish for extra
wishes or other magic cockroaches or anything that gets around having just
three wishes.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I could see I had set the dog
to wondering.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Look,&#8221; I went on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Just tell me what you'd most like in the
world, and you'll see that I grant it.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I could see the creature
drooling, but whether at the thought of food (me) or getting a special wish, I
couldn't be sure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, it said,
&#8220;All right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;ll test you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this better work or else you&#8217;re&#8230;dinner.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Repressing a shudder, I said,
&#8220;Name your wish.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;I want to be free from this
basket.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Snapping two legs together, I
announced, &#8220;One wish coming right up.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And I slipped back through the crack beneath the lid of the basket, flew
ahead of the bicycle, turned my bottom toward the rider, and squirted a very
large dollop of my special defensive juices right in her face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Screaming and blinded, she lost control of
the bicycle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It twisted to the right,
and she wrenched the handlebars the other way, and then it twisted to the left
, and she wrenched to the right, and so on and so no until the bicycle turned
on its side and she went flying into the mud while the basket lid flew open
with the impact and out leaped little Toto, shaken but alive and well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;I guess you really are a
magic cockroach,&#8221; he said.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;What&#8217;s your
name.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Cucaracha.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Well, Cucaracha, I still
have two wishes coming, so you'd better stick with me.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Toto glanced behind me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;And that awful teacher is headed this way,
so hop on my back and let&#8217;s get out of here!&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I glanced back over my
exoskeleton and sure enough, the bicyclist was only a few feet away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I took a huge leap (being a huge cockroach,
in case you might have forgotten), landed on Toto&#8217;s back, and held on to his
fur with all six legs as he took off just ahead of the woman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She ran after us but quickly lost ground and
headed back to her bicycle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I watched
her get on and try to pedal, but immediately, she fell down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She tried again and again, finally realizing
that the front wheel was bent out of shape and she would never be able to catch
us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Pretty slow learning for a
teacher, if you ask me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Toto was tearing down the
road back toward the farm house, which made me a little nervous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Can we go in a different direction?&#8221; I
shouted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;There&#8217;s a girl back there who
wants to cut me into little pieces.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Oh, you mean Dorothy, my
owner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have to go back there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know she must be scared and sad, thinking
she&#8217;ll never see me again.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Personally,&#8221; I shouted, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t mind her being scared and sad just so long as she leaves me in one
piece.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Just hide in my fur and
you'll be safe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Remember, I want to
keep you alive, at least until you've granted me my other two wishes.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Speaking of that,&#8221; I said,
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you use them now?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I&#8217;ll
have done my job, and I can go my own way while you head back to your Dorothy.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t think of
two wishes just at the moment, and I certainly don&#8217;t want to waste any.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I <i style="">will
</i><span style="">&nbsp;</span>use one of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m hungrier than ever.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;You're not still thinking of
eating <i style="">me</i>, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Of course not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At least not yet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I&#8217;ll use another wish to get my favorite food of all.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Go ahead.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know what it is
already?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought you were a
magician.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;A magician, yes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A mind reader, no.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Picky, picky.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All right then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wish for a&#8230;&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And at
that moment, a loud blast of thunder exploded in the distance&#8212;in fact, I could
see a small dark cloud at the horizon behind us&#8212;and made Toto, hard enough to
understand under the best of circumstances, sound as if he were saying
&#8220;tornado.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It didn&#8217;t make sense to me,
but a magician doesn&#8217;t ask wishers to be sensible, only to wish. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Right,&#8221; I said, &#8220;one wish
coming right up.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And I spoke a few
special words which I can&#8217;t repeat here because I can&#8217;t trust you, dear reader,
to keep them a secret and use them only for good.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With that, the cloud that had accompanied the thunder turned into
a funnel shape and headed our way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Well, Mr. Smarty Pants
Cucaracha,&#8221; Toto said, &#8220;where&#8217;s my tomato?&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Tomato?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now I understood what had happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Er&#8230;are you sure that&#8217;s what you said?&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Of course I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Well you see, old chap, old
Toto, old pal, old doggie, I could have sworn you said, &#8216;Tornado.&#8217;&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Tornado?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why in the world would I wish for a
tornado?&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;I asked myself that very
question, but I figured you knew what you were doing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And I did grant your wish, or what I thought was your wish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just look behind you.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Slowing down, Toto looked
back over his shoulder and ground to a shocked halt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;WHAT HAVE YOU DONE, YOU CRAZY COCKROACH???&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;A pretty good tornado, if I
do say so myself.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For you could see
the cloud getting larger moment by moment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Well, undo it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Give me the right wish.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Ah.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You're saying that for your third wish you'd
like me to stop the tornado and also get you a tomato?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That&#8217;s really two wishes, you know. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Though perhaps, given all the confusion, I
could make an exception this once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;No.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m saying give me my proper second wish.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Can&#8217;t do that, I&#8217;m
afraid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A wish is a wish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You can&#8217;t take it back.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;But that wasn&#8217;t my wish!&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Can&#8217;t be helped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Magician&#8217;s rules and all that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am bound only to grant you what I honestly
think you say.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s your job to make
the wish clear and distinct.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;That&#8217;s not fair!&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Who ever said wishing was
fair?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And by the way, perhaps we should
continue this conversation later, in some safe place, like say a storm cellar
at the nearest farm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That tornado is
moving very, very quickly, if I do say so myself.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t you use your
magic to get rid of it for yourself?&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Not allowed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only allowed to grant wishes to others, not
myself.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Deciding he was more scared
of the tornado than angry with me, Toto took off again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the distance ahead we could see Dorothy&#8217;s
farmhouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About the same distance
behind us was the tornado.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we got
closer, I could see a whole set of humans heading for a storm shelter and
gesturing towards Dorothy to join them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But Dorothy had spotted us&#8212;or rather Toto&#8212;and was running in our
direction instead of towards the other people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Behind us came the
tornado.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The gap between us and Dorothy
got smaller and smaller.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dog, the
girl and yours truly met up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dorothy
swept Toto up in her arms and, turning, she ran back towards the farmhouse, the
tornado coming ever closer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Seconds
ahead of the funnel cloud, she crossed through the front door of the farmhouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In her rush, she tripped over the door stoop
and went plunging to the floor, banging her head so hard that even I felt sorry
for her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">At that moment a huge cone of
wind swept around the house, and I could feel us being lifted skyward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since Dorothy was unconscious, I flew from
Toto&#8217;s fur to a nearby window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could
see farm animals and vehicles and a bicycle being whirled about, but eventually
they faded below us and our house just kept going higher.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For what seemed like hours, I could see nothing
at all, but then the wind cleared and a mountain peak came into view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could feel us starting to fall as the wind
faded, and on the top of the mountain I saw a castle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An old woman was standing on a terrace watching us with terror as
we came closer and closer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We barely
missed the turrets of the castle and then came within a few feet of the woman
herself, who was dressed in an outfit full of stars and crescent moons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gently, we floated down and down, missing
the steep wall of the cliff by only a few feet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Finally, we hit ground with a
force that made the whole house shudder&#8212;but it was obviously built well,
because it had managed to stand up to the tornado and now it remained in one
piece.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before I could study where we
had landed, I heard a moan, looked behind me, and saw that the landing had
jarred Dorothy awake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As quickly as
possible, I flew back to hide in Toto&#8217;s fur.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Staggering to her feet,
Dorothy said, &#8220;Oh, Toto, I had a dream that we went on a wild ride into the
sky.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She looked out the window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Thank goodness the storm is over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let&#8217;s go see if Aunt and Uncle are all
right.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">She opened the door and
stepped out, Toto (with me on his back) following.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, you could see at a glance that this wasn&#8217;t Kansas any
more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were facing onto a town square
surrounded by little houses and filled with little people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon as Dorothy emerged, a loud cheer
went up and one particular little person, all dressed up in a pink uniform and
looking very official, stepped forward and bowed to Dorothy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Thank you, kind goddess,&#8221;
the person said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dorothy stammered, &#8220;Thank you
for what?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And I&#8217;m not a goddess.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;You must be a goddess.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only a goddess could have destroyed our
oppressor, the Wicked Witch of the East, who&#8221;&#8212;and he pointed to our left&#8212;&#8220;is
lying there under your flying goddess&#8217; home.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I peered up over the edge of
Toto&#8217;s fur, and sure enough, sticking out from the edge of the house were two
feet, one wearing a Shmeike sneaker and the other a Skecher.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dorothy gasped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to kill anyone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My house must have been blown here by the
tornado.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m so sorry.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t be sorry, great
goddess.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That witch made the life of
all us Munchkins a total misery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now we
are free and can treat each other fairly and justly and peacefully.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Munchkins?&#8221; said Dorothy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never heard of you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What part of Kansas is this?&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Kansas?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t know where that is, but you're now
in the Great State of Munchkinland, on the border of Oz.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Munchkinland??&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And Dorothy looked with teary eyes at the
dog in her arms as I scrunched further into his fur so she would not
accidentally see me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Oh Toto, I think
we must be terribly lost!&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Toto whimpered something at
her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The chief Munchkin spoke
again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know where this Kansas
of yours is, but we can send you to someone who is sure to be able to help you
return, if that is your wish, Goddess.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Please don&#8217;t call me
that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My name is Dorothy.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Yes, Godde&#8230;I mean, Dorothy.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Thank you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now how can you help us get home?&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;We&#8217;ll send you to the </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Almanac MT&quot;;"><span style="">w</span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">izard.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Now that made my hearing
holes get larger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A wizard!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Someone I would surely have something in
common with!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Wizard?&#8221; said Dorothy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;There is no such thing as a wizard.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The Munchkin leader looked
around at the other Munchkins and said to them, &#8220;Maybe she isn&#8217;t a goddess
after all, if she doesn&#8217;t believe in </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Almanac MT&quot;;"><span style="">w</span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">izards.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">For some reason that I never
learned, every time people in Munchkinland referred to the wizard, they managed
to wipe their mouths with the back of one hand so that a blurred sound came out
that sounded more like &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Almanac MT&quot;;"><span style="">w</span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">izard&#8221; than &#8220;wizard.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(I later learned that this motion was considered sacred and had been
passed down from ancient times by a fabled storyteller named </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Almanac MT&quot;;"><span style="">w</span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">ichard.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I
had no time to reflect on this bizarre behavior, for at that moment, I heard a
WHOOOOOSH and looked up to see gliding down from the mountaintop, on a broom,
the old, oddly dressed woman whom the house had nearly hit as it flew towards
Munchkinland.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Munchkins looked up,
too, and they all cheered, almost as loudly as they had for Dorothy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The head Munchkin walked over
to the woman and said, &#8220;Glendora, welcome!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What are you doing here?&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The old woman answered, &#8220;I
was in my mountaintop castle, in the middle of my birthday party, when a
house&#8212;that house&#8212;nearly smashed into my turrets and then nearly took my head
off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I came down to see what it was all
about.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;This goddess&#8230;I mean, this
&#8216;Dorothy&#8217; creature&#8230;flew the house into our town to destroy the Wicked Witch of
the East.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We&#8217;re free!&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Glendora turned to
Dorothy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Young lady&#8212;for I can see you
are no goddess, though certainly a very brave person&#8212;for freeing my good
friends the Munchkins from my wicked sister, I will grant you any boon.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;All I want is to go home to
Kansas.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The chief Munchkin whispered
to Glendora, &#8220;I told her we know of no such place, and I advised her to see the
</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Almanac MT&quot;;"><span style="">w</span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">izard.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Ah, very wise,&#8221; nodded
Glendora.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To Dorothy, she said, &#8220;But if
you want to get back quickly, I can give you a magic shortcut.&#8221; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Oh yes, anything!&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;I will give you something
magical for your feet that will bring you home in a flash.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;I know!&#8221; shouted
Dorothy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Magic slippers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Made of glass, maybe some special color&#8212;like
my favorite, ruby!&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Glendora shook her head in
sadness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;No, Dorothy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps where you come from, glass slippers
are common, but here in Munchkinland I can&#8217;t imagine how they would be made or
who would make them&#8212;or how could wear them without breaking and cutting your
feet.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And with that, Glendora went to
the two feet sticking from beneath the house and carefully removed the Shmeike
and the Sketcher.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;If you put these on
your feet and click your heels&#8230;&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;I know!&#8221; Dorothy shouted
again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Three times!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That&#8217;s always the magic number!&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Glendora and the Munchkins
looked around at each other and shook their heads in disappointment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Glendora turned back to Dorothy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;No, my young hero.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not here in Munchkinland.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, the traditional magic number is
41.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you click your heels 41 times,
you and your little friend in your arms will return to Kansas, wherever it is.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;That&#8217;s a lot of clicking,&#8221;
moaned Dorothy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;But I&#8217;ll have to try
it so Toto and I can get home before anyone gets too worried.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">She took the two sneakers and
tried to put them on her feet, but struggle as she might, she could not get
them on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;I am afraid,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that
my feet have become swollen from all my running and adventures.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Glendora, &#8220;your
only hope is indeed to see the </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Almanac MT&quot;;"><span style="">w</span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">izard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
carry the sneakers with you, just in case.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dorothy pouted and said in a
cranky voice,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;All right.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;The </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Almanac MT&quot;;"><span style="">w</span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">izard will grant you a wish, and in fact will grant
anyone else one wish also.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps your
little friend would like a wish, too.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Oh, Toto can&#8217;t talk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if he could, I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;d just wish to
go back to Kansas with me.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">At that, Toto muttered so I
could hear, &#8220;Can&#8217;t talk!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s that she
can&#8217;t <i style="">understand </i>me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i style="">You</i>
can understand me, Cucaracha.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dorothy shook an index finger
at Toto while holding him with one hand.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>&#8220;Now Toto, you know it isn&#8217;t nice to growl.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are our friends.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">But Toto was really crabby
now, and Dorothy&#8217;s words didn&#8217;t stop him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>&#8220;And if I had a wish, I wouldn't waste it on Kansas when Dorothy can
perfectly well carry me back with her.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I said, &#8220;I myself don&#8217;t need
a wish, since I&#8217;m a magic cockroach.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In my most innocent voice, I asked, &#8220;But what <i style="">would </i>you wish for, Toto?&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;I&#8217;d wish for something
worthwhile, like a tomato.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aren&#8217;t these
Munchkins going to offer us anything to eat?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Don&#8217;t they know anything about hospitality?&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I said, &#8220;A tomato!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Your third wish, Toto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Don&#8217;t worry; I&#8217;ll get it right this
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No more tornados.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when I&#8217;ve granted it, I&#8217;ll be free to
go.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Toto shook himself violently,
almost slipping from Dorothy&#8217;s grip and nearly sending me plunging to the
ground so that I had to grip his fur frantically with all six legs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;No no no no no no
nononononononononooooooooooooooooo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
didn&#8217;t actually make a wish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I only
said I <i style="">would.</i>&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">My trick hadn&#8217;t worked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And I didn&#8217;t have time to try to change his
mind, because I suddenly felt myself swept up in Dorothy&#8217;s free hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I guess I had come unhidden from Toto&#8217;s fur
when he became so upset about the third wish.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Anyway, all I could see now when I looked up was Dorothy&#8217;s eager smile
as she gripped me so that no matter how much I squirmed, I couldn't get loose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;So you traveled with us from
Kansas, did you?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not a very smart
cockroach, I see.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knew you couldn't
escape me forever, especially when you're so huge and ugly.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Huge and ugly, indeed!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was bad enough to plan to cut me into
little pieces, but insulting me as well really wasn&#8217;t fair play at all, as I&#8217;m
sure you'll agree.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Gently, she slid Toto to the
ground and with her freed hand reached into her pocket to pull out her
dissection kit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She opened the lid and
reached in for one of her small, extremely sharp dissection scalpels.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I closed my eyes and covered
them with my two front legs, awaiting the fatal slash, when I heard the voice
of the head Munchkin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;What are you
doing with that cockroach, Dorothy?&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I opened one eye to see the
blade poised an inch from my antennae.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Dorothy said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to dissect it, of course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I love dissecting cockroaches.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Doesn&#8217;t everyone?&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">As if in a single voice, the
Munchkins collectively gasped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their
leader rushed forward and grabbed Dorothy&#8217;s wrist to pull the knife away from
my body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;You can&#8217;t dissect this
cockroach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or any cockroach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Today is Cockroach Appreciation Day in
Munchkinland!&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dorothy&#8217;s mouth turned into a
pout.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;That&#8217;s not fair!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I saw this cockroach all the way back in
Kansas.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Who ever said rules were fair?&#8221;
said the Munchkin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;That&#8217;s our law, and
you must abide by it.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Sulking, Dorothy put the
scalpel back in her dissection kit, closed the kit and returned it to her
pocket.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get too cocky, Mr.
cockroach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We&#8217;ll just wait until
midnight and <i style="">then </i>I&#8217;ll dissect
you.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And she pulled a bow from her
hair, tied one end of it around my mid-section and the other end around Toto&#8217;s
neck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;That should hold you in the
meantime,&#8221; she said.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, if she
had known that I was obligated to stay with Toto until he had his third wish,
she wouldn't have needed to bother with this humiliating treatment of me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Shouts from various Munchkins
went up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;You can&#8217;t do that!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;It&#8217;s not right!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;No way!&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;It&#8217;s only against the law on
Cockroach Appreciation Day,&#8221; snapped Dorothy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;But,&#8221; announced the chief
Munchkin, &#8220;in Munchkinland, <i style="">every </i>day
is Cockroach Appreciation Day.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It looked to me as if Dorothy
was ready to throw a tantrum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then her
face lit up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Tell me something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Does Oz have the same laws as Munchkinland?&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">My exoskeleton shivered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could see where she was going with this.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Well, no.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Then point me on the way to
Oz, and I&#8217;ll kill two birds with one stone&#8212;or one cockroach with one scalpel,
at any rate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;ll do my dissection, and
I&#8217;ll get my wish to go home to Kansas.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I could see the Munchkins
weren&#8217;t very happy with this, but they knew they were stuck.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Glendora spoke up, gently and
sadly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;If it wasn&#8217;t clear before, it
is certainly clear now, Dorothy, that you are no goddess.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My friends will be forever grateful that you
put an end to their oppression by the Wicked Witch of the East, but we will all
jp[e that you come to your senses and spare that poor cockroach&#8217;s life.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Just point me to Oz,&#8221;
Dorothy insisted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Glendora gestured beyond the
village.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Do you see that road out
there that curves and seems to be made of golden rectangles?&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;You mean what looks like a
yellow brick road?&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Forgetting their
disappointment with Dorothy over Cucaracha, the Munchkins buzzed happily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Why what a wonderful name for it!&#8221;
exclaimed the Munchkin leader.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;It has
always been called Wicked Witch of the East Drive, but our first act of
liberation shall be to rename it the Yellow Brick Road!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All in favor, say &#8216;Aye!&#8217;&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">And a unanimous roar went up
from the Munchkins.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Glendora had not forgotten
Dorothy&#8217;s mean streak, however, and sternly she went on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;You follow that road, and eventually it
will lead you to Oz, where you will easily locate the </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Almanac MT&quot;;"><span style="">w</span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">izard&#8212;everybody there knows him.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Remembering her manners,
Dorothy curtsied (which was considered polite in those days) to the Munchkins
and said to them and Glendora, &#8220;Thank you all for helping me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m sorry you don&#8217;t understand about the
importance of dissecting cockroaches, but in every other way you have been kind
to me, and I will never forget any of you.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And with that she picked up Toto (I gripped his neck fur for dear life,
though it didn&#8217;t look as if my dear life had much longer to go) and headed
toward the Yellow Brick Road.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">And so the three of us,
Dorothy, Toto and yours giant truly proceeded down the Yellow Brick Road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To keep up her spirits, Dorothy started
skipping and singing some song about silly rainbows and blue-colored birds, and
pretty soon Toto was merrily skipping alongside her, and before I knew it I was
so caught up in the adventure that I forgot I was dissection material, and I
started starting dancing on Toto&#8217;s neck and singing (a much better song than
Dorothy&#8217;s, if I do say so myself):<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 49.5pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I&#8217;m
Cucaracha, I&#8217;m Cucaracha,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 49.5pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Largest
cockroach ever was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 49.5pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I&#8217;m
Cucaracha, I&#8217;m Cucaracha,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: 49.5pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">On
the golden road to Oz.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Well, Dorothy was skipping so
happily (probably thinking about dicing me up after midnight) that she didn&#8217;t
pay any attention to where she was going, and suddenly, KER-CLANG, she bumped
into an unmoving creature standing in the middle of the road and knocked it
down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Toto braked to a halt, which sent
me flying in a big circle (since I was attached to that disgusting ribbon&#8212;you'd
think a girl of Dorothy&#8217;s age would wash her hair more often) almost cutting my
beautiful abdomen in two with the ribbon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Yelling and moaning, Dorothy
hopped painfully in circles around a creature made entirely of metal&#8212;tin I
realized from having seen tin roofs on the farm back in Kansas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With a savage kick, she knocked the person
down, and he slid into a large puddle of oil in the middle of the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, since the person was made of tin,
the kick only hurt Dorothy&#8217;s foot (it served her right, I thought, and now
maybe she would <i style="">never</i> be able to get
that shmeike and skecher on), and she flopped down into the road alongside the
tin man, clutching and rubbing her foot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Well, the tin man wasn&#8217;t
upset the least little bit in spite of being brutally knocked down by a rude
and spoiled girl.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of scolding
her, he was saying, &#8220;Thank you, thank you,&#8221; over and over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or rather, his head was saying that, several
feet away from his body, having rolled off after hitting the ground so
hard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;I couldn't budge until you came
along because I was all rusted up, but now that you so kindly placed me in this
puddle of oil, my parts are getting less stiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you would only be so kind as to put my head back on my
shoulders, everything would be perfect and I&#8217;d be grateful forever.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Now a properly raised girl
would have replied pleasantly and thanked the tin man for praising her instead
of trying to kick her back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But not
Dorothy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No siree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She hobbled to her feet, yelled angrily, &#8220;I&#8217;m
hurt, and I haven&#8217;t eaten anything in hours,&#8221; and she climbed over the fence
alongside the road into an apple orchard.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even I, the most wonderful giant cockroach in the world, had never seen
apples like these: they were huge, and I could see Dorothy&#8217;s mouth watering as
she eyed them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, she walked
under the largest one of all, as big as a cantaloupe, and jumped high in the
air to pluck it from its branch.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Well, she knocked it loose
all right, but she couldn&#8217;t get control of it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It bounced off her hands, onto her head (so she started moaning even
louder), thudded onto the ground and zig-zagged towards the road, over the
bricks, straight towards the tin man&#8217;s head, which was still calling out,
&#8220;Thank you, thank you, please put my head back on my shoulders, thank you,
thank you.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The apple collided with the
head like one croquet ball hitting another so that the head was set in motion
and, as if by magic, rolled straight to the tin man&#8217;s shoulders, settling into
the clamps for keeping the head attached to the body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The clamps automatically snapped the head back on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">While Dorothy moaned, holding
her aching head (from the apple) with one hand and her sore foot (from kicking
the in man) with the other, the tin man stood up, wriggled its joints several
times to spread the oil throughout them, and then walked to the large
apple.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Picking it up far more gently
than I would have thought possible of an all-metal creature, he walked to the
fence and held the apple out to Dorothy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>&#8220;Here is the food you wanted, kind stranger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps you would now be my friend.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Well, even a brat like
Dorothy couldn't continue to be rude to such a kind creature, and pretty soon
they had exchanged information about each other, Dorothy said that she and Toto
and her soon-to-be-dissected cockroach were going to the wizard (she never
remembered to rub the back of her hand across her mouth when she said the
word).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The tin man said he would like
to go along so that he could get a wish granted, too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His wish was never again to fall into slimy, grimy, nasty messes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">So now it was four of us
traveling together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before too long, we
came to a fork in the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Off in the
corn field beyond the fence was a scarecrow under attack by crows.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;That&#8217;s strange,&#8221; said
Dorothy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;The crows seem to be
terrorizing the scarecrow instead of the other way around.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Toto didn&#8217;t care about
scarecrows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was yapping<span style="">&nbsp; </span>over and over, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go, let&#8217;s go, I&#8217;m
hungry, let&#8217;s go,&#8221; and although Dorothy had said she couldn't understand him,
she crooned, &#8220;All right, Toto, we&#8217;ll go on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Now if we could just figure out which fork to take.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She looked at the tin man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Do you know?&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">He shook his head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">From nowhere, a voice said,
&#8220;This way.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the voice said, &#8220;That
way.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This went on several times until
the tin man pointed at the scarecrow.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sure enough, even as the crows were tearing at its straw, the scarecrow
was trying to point down both paths at once and saying &#8220;This way, that way.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dorothy&#8217;s hand flew to her
mouth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;The scarecrow is alive!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We must save him.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And leading the way, she scurried over the fence, followed by
Toto (bouncing me all over as he hurried) and the tin man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dorothy and the tin man slapped at the crows
while Toto yelped at them until all had flown away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the tin man and Dorothy helped the scarecrow down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The scarecrow looked
pathetic, and Dorothy did the best she could to rearrange its straw and make it
presentable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Why were those crows
attacking you?&#8221; she asked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t
you scare them away?&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The scarecrow&#8217;s voice was
high-pitched and shaky.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;I used to
scare them, but one of their tribes, called the Brave, volunteered to sacrifice
themselves by destroying me so that all the other crows could eat the corn in
this field.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They Brave crows expected
to die, but they discovered that I couldn't actually hurt them, and ever since
then my life has been a misery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All
sorts and sizes of crows eat the corn whenever they want, and when they're full
they have great fun pecking at me.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;That&#8217;s terrible!&#8221; Dorothy
exclaimed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you join us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We&#8217;re off to see the wizard of Oz and get
our wishes granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Toto and I are
going to wish to go back to Kansas&#8230;&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">At this, Toto started
growling again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Hush, Toto,&#8221; Dorothy
said.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;We&#8217;ll get there soon
enough.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She continued to the
scarecrow, &#8220;And the tin man is going to wish never again to fall into slimy,
grimy, nasty messes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What would you
wish for?&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The scarecrow thought and
thought and thought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, he said,
&#8220;I want&#8230;I want&#8230;wait, I&#8217;ve almost got the name, it&#8217;s a&#8230;a&#8230;brain!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, that&#8217;s it!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A brain!&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Good choice,&#8221; said the tin
man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Now can you tell us which fork of
the road goes to Oz?&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The scarecrow put a finger to
his chin and bent his head first this way, then that way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He looked down the left fork, and he looked
down the right fork.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally he closed
his eyes, spun around 41 times (I kept count) and held out one straw arm, which
pointed to the left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;That way!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he announced with total confidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dorothy and the tin man eyed
each other with doubt, and I only hoped that the scarecrow had gotten it wrong
so we wouldn't go to Oz at all and I wouldn't get dissected.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;All right,&#8221; said
Dorothy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go that way.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so we did.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Now there were five of us,
but not for long.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Before you could say, &#8220;PS3
rules,&#8221; a huge beast of the jungle&#8212;a lion&#8212;leapt from behind a tree and blocked
our way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dorothy cowered behind the scarecrow,
who hunched behind the tin man, who didn&#8217;t look very happy himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Raising its long, sharp claws and baring its
teeth, the lion advanced toward us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
Toto, seeing his owner in danger, leapt from her arms and (once again jerking
me from one side of his neck to another as he ran) dashed at the lion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, I thought, is the end of Toto, but
maybe I&#8217;ll be lucky and while eating Toto the lion will bite through the ribbon
around my waist and I&#8217;ll be able to fly away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">But it was not the end of Toto
at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, the lion stopped
short, covered its head with its front paws, and rolled over on its back,
weeping and groaning, &#8220;Please don&#8217;t hurt me!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Please don&#8217;t hurt me!&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Toto stood inches from the
lion and continued yelping at him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Seeing that she was safe, Dorothy stepped forward and addressed the
lion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;You're quite a scaredy-cat,
aren&#8217;t you?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or I should say, a
scaredy-lion.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Please don&#8217;t eat me,&#8221;
mumbled the lion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do anything you
want.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;I thought lions were
supposed to be brave.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; moaned the beast
softly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;We are.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m a disgrace to my kind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Oh how I wish I could find courage.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Well, perhaps you can get
your wish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you promise not to hurt
any of us, you may join our group.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We&#8217;re off to see the wizard and get wishes granted.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;The </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Almanac MT&quot;;"><span style="">w</span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">izard!&#8221; interrupted the lion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Yes, the wizard.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I&#8217;ve never known where to find the </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Almanac MT&quot;;"><span style="">w</span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">izard.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Well, we&#8217;re going to find
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Toto and I are going to wish to
return to Kansas, the tin man will wish never again to fall into slimy, grimy,
nasty messes, and the scarecrow is going to wish for&#8230;&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t say it!&#8221; interrupted
the scarecrow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll remember.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m going to wish for a&#8230;a&#8230;.wish for
a&#8230;brain!&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;In that case,&#8221; whispered the
lion, &#8220;I&#8217;ll wish for a heart.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">So the six of us proceeded
along the Yellow Brick Road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Toto
continued to growl about being hungry, and that made me realize that I hadn&#8217;t
eaten in a long time myself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
wretched Dorothy had interrupted my dinner way back in Kansas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wondered if we might pass a garbage dumps
where I could persuade Toto to romp so that I could have a bite to eat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">But around the next turn in
the road, we suddenly saw in the distance a vast series of magnificent, tall
towers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And before very long, a sign at
the side of the road appeared that read, &#8220;Leaving Munchkinland/Entering
Oz.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, the tin man had
guessed right about which fork to take.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Pulling her dissection kit
from her pocket, Dorothy hurried ahead and crossed to the other side of the
sign.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The tin man, the scarecrow and
the lion were just a few moments behind her. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Come, Toto,&#8221; Dorothy
called.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Toto hung back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;How can I get my third wish
if Dorothy cuts you up?&#8221; he muttered, more to himself than anyone else.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you take your
third wish now?&#8221; I suggested.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Dorothy was stamping her foot
several yards away, just over the Oz border.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Toto paced in a small circle, and finally said, &#8220;All right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;ll take my third wish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I hate to use it this way, but I&#8217;ve gotten
used to you and maybe even to like you a little.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;What is your wish?&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;I wish that Dorothy will
never dissect Cucaracha or hurt him in any way.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I was flabbergasted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had thought of Toto as such a silly
creature, and here he was, giving up riches or happiness in favor of saving my
life!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Thank you, Toto,&#8221; I
murmured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;One wish coming right
up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you bite through the ribbon, you
shall have your wish.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Toto did as I asked, and in a
few moments I was free, flying just above him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>&#8220;I shall always remember you for this, Toto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And I&#8217;m truly sorry about the tornado.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Well, it gave us an
adventure together, didn&#8217;t it?&#8221; Toto chuckled (or as close as a dog can come to
a chuckle), and he padded off to join Dorothy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I could hear her saying,
&#8220;Toto, you bad dog!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How could you let
that wonderful specimen get away?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I may
never forgive you for this.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt
grateful to Toto, and sorry that Dorothy, whom he loved so much, was being so
selfish and rude.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But there was nothing
I could do to help, so I flew high above my former traveling companions and
headed for Oz to see what was there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I never saw any of those
creatures again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I myself stayed on in
Oz awhile and had some fascinating adventures there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But that&#8217;s a story for another time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For now, I hope I&#8217;ve helped set the record straight about what
Dorothy was really like, how that tornado really happened, and so on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And although I can&#8217;t tell you what happened
to Dorothy or the others, I wouldn't be surprised if it went pretty much as the
books say.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maybe someday the tin man or
the scarecrow or the lion will write an account so we&#8217;ll know.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I only hope that Dorothy, if
she did manage to return to Kansas, forgave Toto for being so brave and good to
me, and that she learned to take pity on all creatures, especially my fellow
cockroaches.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

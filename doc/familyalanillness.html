<span style="font-style: italic;">February, 2008</span><br><p>In
January, 2008, my brother-in-law, Alan Singer, had a serious illness.
&nbsp;Since so many people wanted frequent updates on his condition, I
created a blog page to post progress reports and allow people to make
their own comments. &nbsp;In late February, Alan was virtually back to
normal, found the blog page superfluous, and asked me to delete it.
&nbsp;Since the content has become part of family history, we agreed I
would post it here. &nbsp;</p><p>In the first day or two of his
hospitalization, I had a lot of anger about how what I perceived as his
stubbornness&nbsp;seemed to have delayed treatment and perhaps made the
illness more life-threatening than it needed to be. &nbsp;I also
included more medical details than necessary. &nbsp;I&nbsp;decided that
even though a blog is normally a personal forum, this blog should have been as
detached as possible since many people were seeing it and relying on
its information. &nbsp;I therefore edited down my own comments,
including some of the allied but not directly germane medical details, so that the blog content ended
up appearing as below. &nbsp;Because so many students and colleagues
had&nbsp;wonderful things to say about Alan and his teaching, I have
kept those messages intact but removed their contact information.</p><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

<p>My brother-in-law and Judi&#8217;s husband, Alan Singer, has been in the
hospital since Wed., Jan. 23. On Tues., he had a prostate biopsy. That
night he vomited profusely and ran a fever. On Wed. morning he went to
the emergency room at Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn. He
improved for awhile&#8211;Thurs. morning he was sitting up and wanting to
eat. Then he had an extremely serious relapse and was put under
sedation to be unconscious while he healed. He is still sedated as I
write.</p>
<p>I have previously e-mailed the following to some family and friends,
and from now on I will try to update Alan&#8217;s status via this blog. </p>

Thurs., Jan. 24&#8211;notes compiled by Heidi</p>
<p>Came to the hospital with sepsis shock, which is serious.<br>
Low blood pressure<br>
Advanced state of shock.<br>
Numbers for kidney, liver, blood pressure low.<br>
Fluids, alb.<br>
Brain response ok<br>
Kidney function slowly to normal<br>
Acidonic problem leads to agitation and such<br>
Will do CAT scan<br>
Will be kept sedated for awhile<br>
APN (?): kidney, reacting to damage; low blood supply to kidneys<br>
May need dialysis for awhile<br>
Lungs could fill with fluid&#8212;being monitored for that<br>
He is still oxygenating<br>
Blood thin: platelets 60,000 (150,000)<br>
The prostate is not sterile; organisms/bacte<wbr>ria can get into the blood<br>
Cannot necessarily control immune problems<br>
24-hour sedation should help oxygenation and blood pressure<br>

Friday afternoon, Jan. 25:</p>
<p>Judi and I got to the hospital today about 9am . Just before we
left, Alan&#8217;s urologist phoned and said he was a little improved and his
ICU attending physician was now &#8220;cautiously optimistic.&#8221;</p>
<p>(When we got home, voice message from urologist said: biopsy was negative&#8212;no cancer.)</p>
<p>Alan was breathing regularly, color looked fine. Blood pressure was
still low but in an acceptable range. He continues to get blood
pressure medication, which was lowered today until he went for a CAT
scan (more below), when the pressure went down and the medication had
to increase. His urine bag looked as though it was filling reasonably
well, and so far his kidneys are ok. His lungs are still weak and being
helped by attachments.</p>
<p>Events out of order:</p>
<p>CAT scan early this afternoon. Slightly blurred because Alan
couldn&#8217;t keep still, but neurologist said scan looked fine, no brain
damage. Neurologist then reduced sedation so that Alan awoke just a bit to be tested for responsiveness.<wbr> Neurologist said Alan couldn&#8217;t
wake up much&#8212;too many drugs in his system&#8212;but that for now his
responses were normal. More will be checked as Alan becomes conscious,
which likely won&#8217;t be before tomorrow (Sat.) but perhaps longer:
depends on when the medical staff thinks his body will recover ok with
him being awake.</p>
<p>This morning we talked to an infectious diseases doctor. Her group
was called in to determine and monitor his antibiotics. He is
definitely improving, however slowly. Platelet count is still quite
low, and they were going to administer artificial plasma this
afternoon. (Judi had to sign to allow this.) White cells are doing
better. In general, this doctor supported the idea that Alan is slowly
but noticeably improving. She said the problem is a urinary tract
infection and maybe nothing else, but such an infection can have these
profound consequences. Only a urine culture has so far shown a problem
(the one for which they&#8217;re treating him). They have also done blood
cultures Wed. and today. These take a week for full results, though
results after 3 days are unlikely to change. These cultures should
pinpoint whether Alan has any other infections.</p>
<p>This morning we also talked with a urologist who maybe is the head
muckety-muck urologist at this hospital. Alan&#8217;s own urologist, whose
hospital affiliation is LI College Hospital where Alan is, talked to
this other urologist to get help with Alan. I gather that as a result
Alan is getting esp. good care. Certainly I was impressed by how much
attention he was getting, and how open and pleasant all medical staff
are. (Surprise to me: He is not in a room but in a large cubicle open
most of the time to the nursing floor; a curtain is drawn as needed.)
This urologist said he has done numerous biopsies, and in rare cases
patients get septicemia. But I gather recovery from that is not too
difficult, and that Alan&#8217;s problem is far more unusual.</p>
<p>Judi is holding up remarkably well, though as she gets tired she has
more difficulty focusing and retaining information. She dozed briefly
at the hospital a couple of times, but I finally got her home and she
is sleeping contentedly (?) as I write this. She had to sign a 2nd
paper (actually the first of the two) this afternoon, giving permission
to insert a catheter into a large neck vein. It would function like an
IV but allow much more precise monitoring of his drugs, make it easy to
take blood (without constantly invading different parts of his arms or
wherever), and maybe something else. </p>
<p>Judi is thinking she will go to teach Monday, but she agreed her co-teacher could cover in her absence.<br>
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<wbr>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br>
Friday night, Jan. 25:</p>
<p>Dr. Suri, who has been following Alan closely, just called.  Here is what she said.</p>
<p>1. Alan nearly died yesterday, but he is now on the mend. From her
tone, I think she is a little surprised he survived&#8211;she had not seen
anyone this sick this way in many years. &#8220;We are not out of the woods,&#8221;
she cautioned, but she also stressed that she had nothing bad to say.
Everything is either improved or the same&#8211;nothing has gotten worse.
(Earlier today she had said she was very disappointed yesterday because
Alan seemed good in the morning and then got so seriously ill.)<br>
2. E-coli is the problem. He came to the hospital with multi-system
organ failure. The infection caused ALL his organs to try to shut down,
including his heart&#8211;&#8221;myocardi<wbr>al depressant factors,&#8221; extremely bad.<br>
3. For anyone to heal, the immune system must function. Antibiotics and
such can do nothing without help from the immune system. Alan&#8217;s was
very challenged, but has gradually been improving.<br>
4.  He is now off blood pressure medication altogether, and his blood pressure is sustaining itself.<br>
5.  The oxygen being supplied by a ventilator has been cut in half.<br>
6.  His kidneys had threatened to shut down, but they did not completely.  The doctor does not believe he will need dialysis.<br>
7. Electrolytes are getting maintained. (My notes are obscure here&#8211;I
think this means his body is creating the electrolytes he needs.)<br>
8.  His blood count is still sub-normal but no worse.  His blood clotting is weak but no worse.<br>
9. It is unlikely he will be taken off sedatives and return to
consciousness before Sunday, and maybe later than that. He has to be
off the ventilator (and maybe other things) before that can happen.<br>
10.  He is tolerating intravenous food, which apparently is recent though I&#8217;m not sure.</p>
<p>Judi is feeling encouraged intellectually,<wbr> but the frank news about how close he was to death, and the fear that he could relapse, has her very worried.</p>

<p>Sat., Jan. 26</p>
<p>Not much new today. Got to the hospital around 9 am. Alan looked the
same. But his blood pressure by the time we left (3 pm) was much
improved, without blood pressure medication&#8212;a bit under 110/60.</p>
<p>We also learned that Alan has a kind of delirium, which has much (all?) to do with his thrashing when awake.</p>
<p>Sol was at the hospital a good chunk of time, and was great with Judi and Alan&#8217;s nurse-of-the-da<wbr>y.
He also understands a lot of technical details that are (or at least
were) a mystery to me. Martin, Rhonda and Anita also visited.</p>

<p>Didn&#8217;t realize this would be on your blog, instead of e-mailed to
me, Ricky. Have been waiting impatiently, with increasing worry, for
the latest report. Would like to visit Alan tomorrow but my cold is not
cooperating.</p>
<p>Well, I guess reports are encouraging since doctors seem reluctant
to give hopeful info unless there is a clear turn for the better.
Nonetheless, will remain in my crossed finger mode for the present. I
hope the urologist can keep Alan reasonably comfortable for a
significant period so he can fully recover before addressing the
prostate problem.</p>
<p>You are a gem, Judi is valiant, and the visitors are very kind; spread my love around.</p>
<p>Incidentally, if you succeed in getting Alan to seek a second opinion, I&#8217;ll really worry.</p>

<p>Sun., Jan. 27, 11 am.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re shortly off to the hospital, but already an encouraging note:
Maxine called the emergency room before 9 this morning and got a nurse
to tell her that Alan has improved since yesterday. I&#8217;ll post more info
when we&#8217;re back from the hospital.</p>

<p>I am a friend and colleague of Alan&#8217;s and am deeply troubled by how
sick Alan has been (hope I can put that in the past tense soon). Alan
is one determined man and hopefully that will get him through this
fully recovered and as energetic as always.</p>
<p>Give him my love and tell him I am praying for him, even if he not sure prayers work.  We sure do miss him at Hofstra.</p><strong>Michael Pezone</strong></li><li id="comment-17" class="">

<p>Thank you for the continued updates. Literally hundreds of us are
deeply upset, are hanging on your every word, and are hoping for a
speedy recovery.</p>

<p>Dear Richard,<br> Thanks very much for this helpful information. I
am a friend of Alan&#8217;s and, at the moment, his dean. I want everyone to
know that everything is covered for him at school and his only brief is
to rest and to recover. I am encouraging colleagues to send cards and
notes for the present. When he is recuperating at home, feeling better
and getting bored, we will come and see him.<br>
We send our love and good wishes to him and especially to Judy, Heidi
and Marty, Rachel and Sol and to you and Mae. Maureen</p>

<p>I am a student of Alan&#8217;s, and, like everyone, have been very
concerned about what has gone on for the past few days. Best wishes to
Alan for a speedy recovery during this difficult time. I am very
concerned but I know that things will turn out okay. I was wondering if
there were any other updates on Alan&#8217;s present condition?</p>


		</li><li id="comment-20" class="alternate"><p><strong>Doris Fromberg</strong></p>

<p>Alan should know that my return from leave to the office next door
was no reason for him to leave, for any reason, least of all for a
medical reason. Clearly, he is missing all of our best times and should
feel encouraged to return quickly in order to add to the general
rumpus. His absence is a vacuum that limits everyone&#8217;s focus and his
wisdom is sorely missed. Please relay our very positive thoughts about
his smooth return to his particular brand of normal, which I highly
value. Let me know as soon as I am permitted to stop agonizing about
his health. Many hugs to Alan, Judy, and the family.</p>

<p>I am a colleague and friend of Alan&#8217;s. Thank you so much for keeping
us updated as to Alan&#8217;s condition. We look forward to his being up and
around and organizing any non-unionized labor at the hospital into a
strong union.</p>
<p>Once he is home, I am happy to do whatever he needs done on any of the many balls he keeps in the air.</p>
<p>Much love to Alan and his entire family,<br>
Andrea</p>
<p>Michael Pezone:  I can help you with any aspect of Alan&#8217;s classes, so please do not hesitate to call on me.</p>

<p>This is Mae, Alan&#8217;s mother-in-law, with a preliminary report for today (Ricky is still at the hospital):</p>
<p>All the news is good. Alan is awake and off sedation. He seems to
understand everything that is said to him, and tries to talk but is
difficult to understand&#8211;what<wbr> a blow that must be!  Also, the breathing tube is out and he is breathing on his own.</p>
<p>This is the first time I am breathing free. Ricky may write a more
detailed report later this evening. My love to all of you who watch and
care.</p>

Alan is breathing on his own and attempting to communicate; steps
towards recovery!</p>

<p>Sunday evening, 7:45 pm, Jan. 27</p>
<p>My mother has summarized the great news.  I left Alan a little while ago.  He was becoming increasingly understandable,<wbr>
though talking with difficulty. His body is pretty much taking care of
itself except for continuing antibiotics (now 2 instead of 3) and maybe
a couple of other things, including, I think, help for blood clotting.</p>
<p>I learned a lot today.  This will be a long message.</p>
<p>Maxine (my wife, for those who don&#8217;t know me) came to Brooklyn this
morning (we live north of New Haven most of the time), and she, Judi
and I got to the hospital 11 or so. When the ICU physician in charge (I
think that was Suri other days but someone else today) and the
neurologist came round, they thought they might be able to get Alan off
the respirator. He was down now, I think, to 40% oxygen from it. It was
turned off altogether, and Alan was breathing on his own within a
totally safe range (a ratio of under 105 is ok; he varied between 19
and 70, mostly 40s and 50s, so he was doing great). I had an unusually
strong emotion of gratification when I knew he was breathing on his own.</p>
<p>At the same time, the medication was cranked down about 10% every
hour or so. He started around 25 units, got down to 13, started
thrashing a bit, was put up to 16. When it had come down maybe 20%, we
could see him slightly opening an eye and moving his head occasionally.
I started talking to him, unsure if he could hear, but because at times
he grimaced badly, I was concerned that he was conscious and wanting
information but unable to ask. So I kept giving him the same summary of
events over and over, esp. reassuring him about Judi. (Turned out he
didn&#8217;t hear any of this.) An air blood test (I don&#8217;t remember the exact
term) was done after some hours&#8211;everythin<wbr>g today was hurry up and wait&#8211;and he passed.  Some delay, and the breathing tube was out (extibation).</p>
<p>At this point, they also turned off the sedation. He was breathing
on his own. No blood pressure medicine. No sedation. He seemed to
understand everything I said. He asked questions which at first I
couldn&#8217;t understand; but as the minutes passed, he became clearer. One
of his first &#8220;requests&#8221; was for his cell phone to call his friend,
Maureen. (Not allowed.) He started flexing a leg. Why? To build up
strength. Nonononono, Alan. You will probably get physical therapy
later, but right now all your energy has to go into healing.</p>
<p>I gave Alan a detailed account of what had been happening to him and
what friends and family had been doing to help get through this time. I
reassured him about Judi and how well she had done. He asked after the
grandchildren. He seemed totally comprehending, though surely his brain
is still fogged (and maybe will be for awhile) from the sedation.</p>
<p>Judi and Maxine had left around 3 so Judi could nap. I could not
bear leaving until I knew whether Alan was off the breathing tube,
partly for my own edification, partly because I knew the ICU would give
no information over the phone, and partly because if he woke up I
though it important that someone familiar be there. </p>
<p>Alan revived somewhere between 5:30 and 6, and Judi, Heidi and
Maxine came close to 7. Judi and Alan had a kiss&#8211;after getting
permission to remove the mask over his mouth and nose (for humidity, it
turned out, not oxygen)&#8211;and Alan, Heidi and Judi spoke for awhile with
some tears on all sides. Alan apparently is dismayed to learn that his
body could do this to him&#8211;or, as Judi put it, that he is not superman.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br>
Earlier in the day:</p>
<p>Judi and I had another long talk with Alan&#8217;s urologist.  </p>
<p>First, I finally understood how Alan got sick. The prostate biopsy
last Tuesday (not three weeks of months ago, as it feels) involves
puncturing the rectum to get at the prostate for samples. E-coli
inevitably gets through to the prostate this way. Normally&#8211;in the
overwhelming number of cases (including my own when I had this biopsy
18 months ago)&#8211;the antibiotics taken before and after the procedure
kill off this rogue e-coli. In Alan&#8217;s case, he (or the e-coli) was
resistant to the antibiotics. The result was as I&#8217;ve previously
described&#8211;a general attack on Alan&#8217;s body.</p>
<p>I asked about convalescence. I do not promise the following is
entirely accurate, and the urologist stressed that different people
need different recuperations. But this is probably a reasonable arc of
recovery. (We&#8217;ll know better as time passes.)</p>
<p>At some point before too long, when he doesn&#8217;t need ICU monitoring,
he&#8217;ll go to his own room in the hospital. He will probably be in the
hospital another 1-2 weeks (more likely 2). That time will likely
include physical therapy (though muscles do not have atrophy in the
time he has been asleep or will continue to be bedridden).</p>
<p>He will at some point go home, where he must convalesce for some
time. I gather that time is between roughly 2 or more weeks. He will
not be able to return to work for some time (my guess is a month or
so). When he can work, he apparently will be unable (i.e., not allowed)
to drive at first, but could go if driven by someone else or a car
service.</p>
<p>Sol and Richard came by this afternoon while Alan was still sedated.
They are taking charge of Alan&#8217;s car from here on. (Have I previously
mentioned that the car was found? Thanks, Mel.)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if Dr. Suri would yet drop &#8220;he&#8217;s not out of the woods,&#8221; but I am only looking to consistent, steady recovery.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who has sent good wishes. I am unlikely to
mention them all to Alan, but I expect they will touch him greatly when
he reads through this blog.</p>

<p>I am a graduate student of Alans and I was devastated to hear this
news. I just wanted to say say that my prayers and best wishes are with
Alan and the whole family. It sounds like things are starting to turn
around for the better. I am happy to hear this and excited to see Alan
return to Hofstra and create havoc like only he can.</p>

<p>I am a grad.student of Alans, the news was a complete and awful
shock. As he knew, i was out in Indiana at the time when I received
word about Alan. Thanks to this blog, the updates have been helpful and
now very reassuring. My thoughts are with him, and his family. It is
very clear and obvious how important Alan is to his students. Get well
soon (we know you will!)<br></p>

<p>Thanks for the good news. I will be in to see Alan as soon as you
think it wise. Mike and Andrea, thanks for your help on the matter of
Alan&#8217;s spring classes. Would you give me a call tomorrow about details?
I have the papers submitted by students in the January classes. I know
what Alan required, so I can grade them. ANyone know where his grade
book is so I can get the rest of the information I need for posting the
grades?<br> You know that you have a small army of people eager to be
of help whether it is helping with care while he recovers. or providing
transportation once he is able to return, on a limited basis, to
Hofstra. Meanwhile we are all so relieved that he has made this
progress. THe news on Friday was like hearing that the ROck of

<p>I am a student, and also a friend.. Leave it to Alan to dodge a bullet, even a freakish one like that. </p>
<p>One has to think that his indominatable spirit fought off the
catasrophe of organ closure. Who else would you put your smart money on
in the face of such adversity?</p>
<p>Alan is too considerate to leave us so soon. Thanks for hanging on.
Can&#8217;t wait to see you in fighting shape. In the mean time we&#8217;ll keep a

<p>First, I&#8217;d like to say thank you to Alan&#8217;s family for keeping us all
up to date with the latest news. I was an undergraduate student of
Alan&#8217;s, with hopes of beginning the graduate program with him in the
Spring. I was extremely upset to hear about his condition and have kept
him (and his family of course) in my prayers (even though Alan&#8217;s an
atheist, and would probably argue with me that it&#8217;s wasted breathe, I
thought it couldn&#8217;t hurt). I wish him a full and fast recovery and his
family the warmest thanks for all of the info. Alan has truly touched
so many lives- I couldn&#8217;t imagine Hofstra without him. Thank you again
and I wish Alan and his family the best.</p>


		</li><li id="comment-41" class=""><p><strong>Liam Binsack</strong></p>

<p>I am so thankful for the good news about Alan&#8217;s condition. He is one
of those rare people you meet in life who can truly bring out the best
inside of people. My best wishes go out to Alan and his family for a
speedy and successful recovery. I&#8217;m sure the doctors will have a
difficult time keeping him home recuperating with his energy and
passion for life.</p>


		</li><li id="comment-42" class="alternate"><p><strong>john mannebach</strong></p>

<p>Thank you for the good news and frequent updates. I am a student of
Alan&#8217;s, having received my undergraduate degree in December. I want to
continue with the graduate program, and tried to contact him this past
week not knowing that he had fallen so ill. When I found out about his
condition, I was deeply concerned and saddened, hoping in my heart that
his strength would carry him through. I look forward to beginning the
graduate program with Alan once he returns. Alan still has so much to
teach, not just to myself but also to a lot of people. He should know
how important he is, and how his leadership and enthusiasm have
influenced so many lives. I wish only the best for him and his family
and friends in these difficult times, and hope to speak to, work with,
and learn from Alan again very soon.</p>


		</li><li id="comment-43" class=""><p><strong>Richard</strong></p>

<p>This will be my final first-hand report.</p>
<p>Alan is doing great. Today he was breathing without a mask and
actually sat up in a chair. He gave me tasks to handle re a MSS and
course outlines. Maureen visited and I gather he handled grading with
her. Since he is still in the early stages of recovery, one might
detect a bit of extra crankiness in his tone. At his request
(insistence?) I read to him from the NY Times, and of course he was
most interested in political matters (not primaries but, say, Israeli
opening of Gaza crossing).</p>
<p>I am returning home to CT tonight. I thank everyone for the good
wishes to Alan and the lovely comments to me about maintaining this
blog&#8217;s history of Alan&#8217;s condition.</p>


		</li><li id="comment-44" class="alternate"><p><strong>Peter Stein</strong></p>

<p>I am yet another former graduate student fortunate enough to have
had Alan as a mentor. I am thankful to Mr Yanowitz and Mike Pezone for
keeping us all updated, as I was very concerned for Alan&#8217;s health. I
now hope that Alan will speedily return to the work of saving the world
one social studies teacher at a time. We all know that there is truth
in that statement.</p>

<p>I am a current graduate student of Alan&#8217;s. Thanks so much for the updates and the good news.</p>

<p>Do tell him he should be reading the WSJ for more accurate news.</p>

<p>As a colleague and friend of Alan&#8217;s at Hofstra, I have to thank all
of you who have added information on Alan&#8217;s condition and continued
progress. It has been such a help to know that he is improving,
although in all honesty, it is hard to comprehend that Alan could be
brought down, if only temporarily, against his will. His spirit, I
suspect, is as resilient and non-compliant (even when sedated and on a
ventilator) as it is every day - and I expect that it won&#8217;t be long
before we hear that the hospital will let him go home early&#8230; because he
is driving the staff crazy.</p>
<p>My thoughts and prayers are with him and Judi and all the family.
Hofstra just isn&#8217;t the same without him - and if there is any way to
help until he is able to return to us, I too am available&#8230; Linda</p>

<p>I wanted to let everyone know, especially Richard (my uncle Ricky)
who went home to CT today after five intense days at my mother&#8217;s and
Alan&#8217;s side, that Alan was moved out of ICU this evening and into his
own room at the hospital. My brother Solomon was with him, told me that
he continues to do well, and that he is now eating solid food.</p>
<p>Ricky, again, thank you for being here, for taking charge, for
helping us all to understand what happened to Alan. You know how
grateful I am, and I want to say publicly that I don&#8217;t know what we
would have done without you. You were tireless and constant, and being
able to rely on you so totally was a tremendous comfort and relief.
Marty, Sadia and Gideon thank you too.</p>
<p>Thanks also to all of our friends, old and new, and for the lovely,
touching notes from Alan&#8217;s students and colleagues. This has been a
very scary time for all of us who love Alan, and everyone&#8217;s support has
meant so much.</p>

<p>In the last half-hour I heard from Alan&#8217;s urologist and from Judi
(who is more up-to-date than the urologist). Here&#8217;s what I understand.</p>
<p>Judi says Alan&#8217;s speech is a bit slurred, and she hasn&#8217;t asked why
yet (I&#8217;d guess it&#8217;s normal after all he&#8217;s been through, including, as
Judi pointed out, all the junk that was in his mouth and throat for 4
days). </p>
<p>But otherwise the news continues to be good. He was rejecting
hospital food today because it tasted so bad, and when Dr. Suri came by
(I still don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m spelling her name right), she said Alan
could have anything to eat he wants. Heidi got him some soup from the
cafeteria. I suppose some visitors might want to bring something
nutritious and tasty.</p>
<p>Today he started physical therapy. (I still don&#8217;t understand for
what exactly.) He is scheduled to go home on Friday. How long he&#8217;ll
have to stay home recovering depends on&#8230;the usual things, I imagine&#8211;his
pace of recovery, his cooperation, his heeding medical advice, and such
like. His urologist had the impression that Alan is being compliant
with what the medical people are telling him. (Who woulda thunk it?)</p>
<p>The urologist said he&#8217;d keep me updated as well as Judi, so I may have more to report as the days pass.<br>

<p>Thank you Ricky for all your news, help, and clarity. You are a gem.
We were so worried about Alan [and Judi] and you really gave us the
information that we needed. We will be happy to see Alan at home soon.

		</li><li id="comment-65" class="alternate"><p><strong>Richard</strong></p>

<p>I report the following 3rd-hand, so don&#8217;t take it to the bank.  Today:<br>
1. Alan had the catheter (or whatever it&#8217;s called that was a conduit
for medication, withdrawing blood, and other stuff) from his neck.<br>
2.  He is scheduled to have the Foley catheter (for urine) removed tomorrow.<br>
3. He walked a little but does not have much strength for moving his
body parts. (This must have something to do with the physical therapy
he&#8217;s getting. What I still don&#8217;t understand is the relation between his
actual weakness and his (supposedly) not having muscle atrophy.)<br>
4.  He will still go home on Friday.  Sol and Mel will drive him.<br>
5.  He will convalesce at home for a few weeks.</p>
<p>A propos the thrashing when he was first in the hospital and had to
be sedated, I have forgotten to mention that soon after he awoke he
spoke about furious itching that he had at the time, which presumably
was an important factor in his thrashing.</p>
<p>Judi continues to go back and forth to the hospital and, I gather, rest as she needs to.</p>

<p>Alan is coming home tomorrow (2/1) I have been assigned the task of

2.  He is weak but slowly gaining strength.  It will take awhile.<br>
3.  Judi is looking forward to his being home&#8211;and her being able to rest.</p>
<p>This will likely be my last health update. Unless I&#8217;m informed

<p>I was deeply saddened to hear about Alan falling ill. I am very
happy to hear that he is well on the road to recovery. As a former

teaching and even basketball! It has to be those NYC roots! Wishing you
all the best Alan!</p>

<p>Alan outlined a post that he wanted me to add:<br>
1.  He came home yesterday around midday and is delighted to be home.<br>
2. He still has little strength and will be building it up as time
passes. He can&#8217;t yet sit up at his computer for more than a couple of
minutes.<br>
3.  He doesn&#8217;t yet have much sense of sequence of events since he&#8217;s been awake&#8211;they become a bit of a blur as time passes.<br>
4.  His mind is otherwise working extremely well.<br>
5.  Today he will see his grandchildren for the first time since this all began.  He can hardly wait.</p>
<p>Once he has the strength to do so, Alan will post his own reports here.</p>

of your health complications. I read that you are on the way home. That
is music to my ears. I expect to see you in person soon..but, not to

think it was worse for many of you, because I didn&#8217;t know a lot of
this. I want to thank family, friends, students and colleagues for
their support.</p>
<p>I know that some of you do not want to hear this, but I&#8217;ve been to the otherside,<br>
and I have to report&#8211; there isn&#8217;t anything there.</p>
<p>Love to all.</p>
<p>Alan</p>

<p>Glad to see you&#8217;re feeling better Alan!! If you need anything please
let me know (I don&#8217;t live far!). Also if you want me to look for
anything for you at the conference please let me know. I hope you have
a speedy recovery and uneventful recovery. Enjoy the time off.</p>

<p>So glad to hear you&#8217;re home and feeling better Alan!! I&#8217;m sure
Hofstra isn&#8217;t the same without you. Make sure you take all the time you
need to fully heal and recover, but get better fast!!!</p>

<p>Alan, I am elated to find out that you are well and that you are
recovering. My mother and I send you our best wishes. I hope to see,
speak, and/or hear from you soon. Take Care.<br></p></li><li id="comment-82" class=""><p><strong>Briana Eckert</strong></p>

<p>I am so happy Alan is getting better! I only recently found out he
was sick and of course was upset until i read he was home and doing
better. I recently graduated Hofstra and would not have if it wasn&#8217;t
for him. I hope you make a speedy recovery and come back to Hofstra
soon because your students need you more than anyone. I&#8217;ll keep you in
my prayers.</p>

<p>The story is now nearly complete. Evidently I was briefly exposed to
kryptonite and I had a severe reaction. Who knew? I am now in my
Fortress of Solitude on the mend and expect to start back to work as a
defender of social justice this week, albeit on a part-time basis.
Thanks to everyone for their cards, email, calls, and kind words.</p>

<p>So nice to see you on the mend, Alan. As to your comment on February
4th, I say, you may have seen the other side but thankfully, you didn&#8217;t
go far enough to see anything, lol. I will continue to pray for you
anyway.

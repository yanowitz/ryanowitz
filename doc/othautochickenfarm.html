<p class="MsoNormal">On the first of our two chicken farms, my father built one
structure that sticks in my memory: a high barn-like building with an A-frame
roof (if that&#8217;s the right term: my knowledge of architecture, like that of
music, is abysmal).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have a memory of
siding that was a very soft material, not wood, a few times the thickness of
cardboard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have no memory of what was
inside the building, though probably chicken feed and farm equipment; I just
remember the presence of the building (probably much smaller than it looms in
my memory), which my father dubbed The Monstrosity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think it was years before I got the joke&#8212;to me, &#8220;The
Monstrosity&#8221; (probably always mentally capitalized) was the name of the
building as a rural English home might be called The Brambles.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Somewhere along the line I became involved in farm chores,
though I don&#8217;t remember at what pace.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Chores included filling metal (probably zinc) buckets with one of two
types of food (a gray-green mash or a grain mélange, dominated by corn kernels,
called &#8220;scratch&#8221;), loading them onto a wheelbarrow, struggling to wheel the
barrow to the coop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have the sense
that to save myself trips I loaded the barrow as full as it could be (3 or 4
buckets on the barrow itself, one each slung over the extended handles that you
gripped to lift and push) rather than making the push easier by keeping the
barrow contents to just a couple of buckets.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As far back as I can remember, minimizing the amount of time required to
do any work has been a priority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(When my
parents forced me to take piano lessons&#8212;about 4 years, around age 8-12&#8212;the
knowledge of the unchangeable timer ticking off my practice hour weighed on
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps that was at least in part a
heritage of this driving force to do as little work as possible and compress it
wherever I could.)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The mash went into &#8220;hoppers,&#8221; long metal troughs, much
narrower than pig troughs, with roosts running the length on either side maybe
a foot off the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The scratch was
scattered over the mixture of manure and some kind of straw that covered the
floor&#8212;but you were supposed to distribute evenly, waving the slightly tilted
bucket in all directions so that the scratch made a thin film on the surface.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Cleaning the water pans was, I think, the most hateful
task.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The structure I remember was
this; though it may have applied only to our 2<sup>nd</sup> farm, where my
father built the coop himself: There were 6 pans in each room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each pan was suspended with at the rim of a
concrete cylinder maybe 12-18 inches high.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The cylinder was mounted over a drainpipe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pan obtained water via a float mechanism not unlike a toilet
flush bob: a flat metal strip maybe a half-inch wide and 6 inches long had a
hollow metal &#8220;float&#8221; (the shape of a tuna fish can and a bit smaller) at one
end and was attached to a water valve device at the other, which in turn was
attached to a vertical water pipe that connected to a pipe below the coop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the float was low enough, water would
trickle into the pan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the water
buoyed the float high enough, the water stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Above the pan and float mechanism was a conical mesh cover made
of strong wires that allowed the birds insert their heads and drink without
climbing into the pan.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Chickens make incredible amounts of dust (and I was allergic
to dust, so summers would be especially miserable for me).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The water pans would fill with a layer of
wet dust at the bottom&#8212;at times probably close to a half-inch deep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But in addition there would usually be
chicken turds embedded with the dust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
clean the pan you made a circular motion either with the palm of your hand or
with a brush like a dishwashing brush.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You got the watering swirling at a good speed without sloshing over the
top of the pan and onto the coop floor, and with the right timing you lifted
the pan and let its contents pour within the cement cylinder and down the
drain.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Problems?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The water
would freeze in winter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I don&#8217;t
remember if the pipes ever froze or why they wouldn't).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conical covers could get knocked out of
alignment or even pushed open so that birds could splash in the pans; I have
the sense that sometimes these covers were missing altogether.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A bird sitting in the pan might sit on the
float and keep it down so that it flooded indefinitely onto the manure on the
floor (sometimes the float would stick of its own accord and have the same
effect) so that a few or several dozen square feet might be drenched, with chickens
tracking the muck everywhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes
the drain down which you threw the dirty water would become clogged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t remember how you fixed these
problems&#8212;only that they were disgusting.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The coop had five rooms.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The center one was the &#8220;feed room&#8221; and contained supplies like feed and
egg-sorting equipment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Within it was a
smaller room walled with dry wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
had a thick, heavy door, and without any mechanical device I can remember, it
retained a relatively low temperature, which was especially important in
summer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Except when you were sorting them,
here is where you kept the eggs until they were picked up by a middle man in what
was probably a panel truck or small van.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The base of the coop on our second farm (the coop my father built)
had concrete-block walls maybe five feet high.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The roof sloped from maybe 15 feet in front to perhaps 6 feet in
back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the four rooms that held
chickens, above the concrete blocks the front of the coop had wide and high open
frames covered with chicken wire; the back wall had a low version of the same
principle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Against the rear, from one
side of the room to the other, was a wooden roost with wood supports every
several feet to hold up the several parallel perches. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The side walls of each room had multiple banks
of three-tiered (or was it four tiers?) metal nests; each tier probably held
five or six discrete nests large enough for one chicken to sit contentedly but
too small for two birds. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Hens were
supposed to lay eggs in the nests. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>When
it came time to collect eggs&#8212;twice a day, I think&#8212;you might find several eggs
in a single nest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You might also find a
territorial hen that refused to leave the nest and pecked viciously at your
hand when you reached in; you learned to move your hand quickly with such
birds, first at the heads to shove aside the beaks, then behind the neck to
grab the bird in the angle her wings formed with her body and pull her out in a
single motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hens might break or
crack eggs in the nest, and they typically loved to eat the insides.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when collecting eggs, it wasn&#8217;t enough
to check every nest; you also had to scour the floor, because some birds might
lay eggs anywhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The worst was if
they lay the eggs in the rear of the room beneath the perches: to get there meant
crawling under the roost or picking your way over it and then reaching down.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal">You collected eggs in round metal baskets about 18 inches
high and two feet in diameter, usually with rubber covering the metal
wire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even with such cushioning it was
easy to break or crack eggs in the basket&#8212;all you had to do was move the basket
a little too fast and get the eggs rattling against one another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An egg with a cracked shell (called a &#8220;crack&#8221;)
was edible but unsaleable except at a low price, so usually you'd segregate
them for the family to eat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You&#8217;d fill
a basket two-thirds&#8212;about 100 eggs&#8212;and then tote the basket to the feed room, You'd
fetch another basket and keep going until all eggs were collected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->You did this twice a day.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><a href="othautochickenfarm.html#topofpage">Top of page</a><br>Back to <a href="Otherautobiography.html">Other personal autobiography</a> page<br><a href="file:///E:/web%20site/kompozer/index.html"><b></b></a><b><a href="index.html"><b>HOME PAGE</b></a></b></body></html>

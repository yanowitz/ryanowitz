<p style="font-style: italic;" class="MsoBodyText2">Early morning we&#8217;ll take advantage of hiking trails in
the hills around Villa Decary for for birdwatching and exploring the tropical
rainforest, where with luck, one can see a family of nesting turkeys, a species
of poison dart frog, the elusive White-Collared Manakin or the distinctive
Long-Tailed Tyrant and Squirrel CooCoos.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Later, we&#8217;ll pack up and head over to Monteverde Cloud Forest where the
bird watching portion of the trip will peak. A privately owned reserve atop the
continental divide, Monteverde protects six different wildlife communities on
both the Caribbean and Pacific slopes. Among the over 400 bird species found
here, the Resplendent Quetzal is considered to be the most beautiful bird in
the world.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cloudforest is
characterized by dense vegetation with majestic trees, ferns, bromeliads,
vines, mosses and a side array of orchids.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Koky, our guide, grew up in Monteverde, and has helped train many of
Monteverde&#8217;s guides. His knowledge and enthusiasm is why he is widely regarded
as one of the top guides in the cloudforest. He will guide us in a variety of
bird and wildlife hikes steeped in natural history of the cloudforest.
Overnight Trapp Lodge, Finca Valverde, Swiss Hotel Miramonte, or similar.</p>

<p class="stblpara">I sleep well and am up at 6.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But I have had troubling dreams again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During an audition with an
attractive young woman, I grip her hand with passion, and she pecks a kiss at
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think, &#8220;Wow, cool in-the-moment,
spontaneous acting; the moment is real.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I can&#8217;t find my script.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I watch some new adventure TV show set in a
city.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am in the show, cast for the
future.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I try to figure out how I could
have been watching the show and yet get into it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the next shoot I find I am a side player, and that Jason is
with the show, acting but also advising on technical stuff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="stblpara">One of the lodge owners says, &#8220;You can&#8217;t improve upon nature;
you can only&#8230;&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I missed the rest, but
the sentiment is interesting and illustrates the broad anti-technology side of
the nature vs. artifice divide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
probably typical of many in our group and of many American ex-pats in Costa
Rica (though perhaps not those who buy land, clear it, and build homes).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The comment also exemplifies the way we like
to make pronouncements of the ideas of which we want to spread.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Do we expect someone to disagree and start
an argument?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Do we think anyone is
really paying attention, or at least evaluating this comment and is prepared to
debate it?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Who really wants to hear
anyone with especially fervent beliefs?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And is there a way I can overcome this resistance to my own concerns?</p><p class="stblpara">The room on the left is ours; the other pictures are views
from the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lake is an
artificial one, created by a dam.</p><p class="stblpara">Below the lodge in the distance is a large artificial lake
that looks real but has been created by a dam.</p>

<p class="stblpara">On the bus I&#8217;m reading <i>The Truth of Ecology</i>, intro and
chapter 1: so much (witty) sarcasm towards &#8220;ecocriticism&#8221;; makes me
self-conscious about where I agree or disagree with the author (if I disagree,
I&#8217;m the butt of the wit, too).</p>

<p class="stblpara">We get gas and then stop at a large expensive souvenir shop
(with an attached small café) where (1) I see an SUV parked with a spare on the
back that has a padlock; (2) I shit and per a posted sign put toilet paper down
the toilet but it clogs anyway (I tell the owner/proprietor); (3) I see another
SUV with Costa Rica license plates and a &#8220;God bless America&#8221; bumper
sticker.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Here and later in the trip,
Maxine checks out a few things but buys nothing; we will have nothing to
declare at US customs.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I silently
wonder about the local natural resources that have gone into creating (by hand?
machine?) many of the artifacts for sale.</p>


<p class="stblpara">We drive all morning.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The roads again are terrible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
go around much of the dammed artificial lake (Lake Arenal?), and Arenal volcano
is constantly visible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We pass sale signs
for buildable land and many houses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
the day progresses and we are hours on the bus, I get increasingly angry about
the amount of (uncomfortable) driving; it is nearly impossible (and sometimes
actually impossible) to read with such bouncing (in addition to distracting
conversations around me that advance my churlish mood).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At most times I know that neither the roads
nor conversation should be tailored to me, but it is informative that I can be
irrationally selfish these ways.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
difficult travel is interesting for awhile, taking us to parts of the country
that we would likely otherwise never see, but had I to do it again, I would
have wanted to plan a trip with a number of short plane hops in place of the
very long drives which must consume a good third of our waking hours.</p>







<p class="stblpara">We pass through hilly countryside that reminds me of rural
England, with some grazing cattle, stands of trees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Koky or Josh says that 80 years ago this was all primary forest
that followed the same devolution as tropical rain forests: swidden, farming,
exhausted soil, grazing land.</p><p class="stblpara">Silently thinking there must be a more congenial route to
Monteverde (a region, not a town), where we are going, I ask about the roads
and am told there are just 3 into Monteverde, all of similar quality, each
coming from a different direction.<span style="">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="stblpara">We take a rest stop around 11:30.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here there is a church behind which is a field of dozens of tree
stumps.</p>

<p class="stblpara">We reach Santa Elena, Koky&#8217;s town within Monteverde and park
just off the short, busy main street (200 yards long?) in the town.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We see a couple of streets here paved with
bricks&#8212;seems so bizarre in the midst of so much roadbed that is dirt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I get $50 from the ATM across the street
(later I learn that the exchange rate is so close to 500:1 that it really isn&#8217;t
worth the effort; but I&#8217;ve been wanting to do this since we got to Costa
Rica.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bank is structured like
Parisian ones these days, with an air lock for one person at a time between the
outdoors and the bank proper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Outside
is a uniformed man with a weapon&#8212;a shotgun, I think.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never learn whether he is a cop or a private guard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ATM, it turns out, is on the side of the
building.</p>

<p class="stblpara">Lunch is at a decent second-story restaurant on the main
drag.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are running late, and at least
a couple of our group wander around the town while the rest of us in the
restaurant wait for them to return so we can order; this annoys me a great
deal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(By now I have realized that most
of the group tends to do whatever is in front of them at the moment&#8212;e.g., this
shopping, or getting off the bus for a photo opportunity&#8212;and as a result
whatever is planned for late in the day gets short shrift.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This general tendency has annoyed me for
awhile, especially in light of having missed much of the hike at La
Selva.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As usual, once we&#8217;ve ordered
it&#8217;s a long wait for the food, and during that time I go to a grocery down the
street to buy some snacks to share with the group (peanuts, which we&#8217;ll eat;
two different kinds of tortilla chip, which we won&#8217;t), desperate to be back so
that I don&#8217;t hold anyone up but also unwilling to sit twiddling my thumbs while
we wait for the food.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In fact, I&#8217;m
back maybe a bit after the food is served, but I eat quickly (but then I always
do, alas) and am done before others.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Maxine and I decide not to do the zip line; although I had toyed with
it, I have had more information that gives me an (accurate, it turns out) image
of being suspended high off the ground.</p>

<p class="stblpara">Back in the bus we pass Koky&#8217;s and his mother&#8217;s homes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally we arrive at the cloud forest, very
late now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We see a number of coatis at
the entrance; they are like pets, with no fear of coming close to humans.</p>



<p class="stblpara">I learn that &#8220;rain&#8221; forests have very different
ecologies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>La Selva was lower down,
less wet, and had a richer variety of wildlife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This cloud forest is much higher, very wet (and so there are no
clearing fires as in drier forests), which limits the variety of species by
providing fewer niches.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We see lots of
secondary growth, some primary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
climb numerous steps (with which I have no trouble) that are made mostly of
bricks with six circular holes through them in two rows, top to bottom.</p><p class="stblpara">Koky says it took about 10 years to build the network of
trails; it is another example of what looks like labor-intensive work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Koky is intent on finding a resplendent
quetzal, and when we finally see it, it is indeed impressive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was never in a position where I could see
its head, but the body and long tail are (resplendently) multi-colored.</p>

<p class="stblpara">Koky picked up his car at his home while the bus continued to
the hotel. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>I said: &#8220;OK, Maxine, this is
your big chance for a coup de control.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This got big laughs from everyone on the bus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was I being cruel to Maxine, who knows her tendency to try to
take charge?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She acted as though
(pretended?) she, too, was entertained.</p>

<p class="stblpara">Our lodging is the Finca Valverde, with wood cabins a hefty
walk from the main building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the
long day and annoying delays, I feel very cranky making this walk, and I
announce aloud that there is no way we are bringing our bags down this long
distance when we leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(In later days
it doesn&#8217;t seem so far.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I feel I am a
child in camp, except that the room is large.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A low loft would sleep a couple of more people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="stblpara">This is our first room with a TV, and we&#8217;ve seen no
newspapers (though we knew that the Costa Rican presidential election was still
too close to call&#8212;Arias led slightly, and both top candidates had just over the
40% threshold).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I scan through shows,
which strike me as ridiculously happy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Only a few days in Costa Rica and the US culture presented on
TV&#8212;relentless happy shows over trivial matters (e.g., so-called reality shows,
quiz shows)&#8212;seem discordant, ludicrous.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The main news story on CNN is the capture in the UK of a man suspected
of killing his wife and child; this is the hot headline being repeatedly
covered, and the crawl frequently refers to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think: I&#8217;m watching Rome decline while everyone pretends things
are wonderful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, it is
probably not the US alone that is failing but the world&#8212;though who knows which
will crash first, a desperate third world or a US in material withdrawal?</p>

<p class="stblpara">Dinner is in a local restaurant a few buildings from where we
had lunch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Koky brings a couple of his
kids, who seem charming though one daughter about 5 is very energetic (someone
suggests with ADD).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>G makes great
friends with her and says that he doesn&#8217;t ever want to leave here because of
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have orange chicken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maxine crashes early, and since we walked
from the hotel, we have the freedom to leave, which we do.</p>

<p class="stblpara">During the day I switch from reading <i>Truth of Ecology</i>
to Coates&#8217;s <i>Nature</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The former
feels important to know but is very hard to keep at, and I decide not to knock
myself out.</p>

<p class="stblpara">To sleep about 10. Wake several times in the night thirsty,
pee 3 times.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Feb 10, Friday</b></p>

<p style="font-style: italic;" class="MsoBodyText2">After an early breakfast, we&#8217;ll head over to St. Elena
Cloudforest Reserve. Here we&#8217;ll enjoy the spectacular experience of walking on
the clouds over a series of tension bridges called Sepulverde Canopy Tour.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For those who are feeling more adventurous,
for an extra charge you can don a rock-climbing harness and zip through the
cloudforest from platform to platform on Sepulverde&#8217;s zip line system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the afternoon we&#8217;ll choose from a variety
of activities, including bird watching for Emerald Toucanets, MotMots and
Quezals at the Children&#8217;s Eternal Rainforest or the famous Hummingbird garden
at Monteverde Cloudforest Reserve.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Wake at 6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>CNN still
has trivial news.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>6-12&#8221; of snow
expected in NY/CT.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Shower stall has a clumsy door that comes off; faucet near
floor also comes loose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
shelving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lots of trouble with right
contact lens falling out; on this trip I&#8217;ve generally had considerable trouble
getting contacts in (and they're new ones).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>French toast for breakfast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
say that I&#8217;m amazed by the energy everyone has to talk to each other; I get
exhausted after awhile from talking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
am trying to establish the legitimacy of my being quiet, withdrawn, private.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">M asks me about the notes I&#8217;ve been taking, and I tell her
they are serving several purposes, including a record of any bi-polar
behavior.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(This has been a possible
diagnosis lately; over the coming months it will be dismissed.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>G orders breakfast close to the time we must
leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m very annoyed and call out in
a laughing voice that he must eat in three minutes. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>He does in fact eat quickly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>E does not show at all til it is time to leave, and this, too, annoys me
(though I don&#8217;t think E had any breakfast).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We go for the canopy walk.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While others are checking out a shop, I mount vertical spiral stairs to
the first bridge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the ground it
doesn&#8217;t look so high, but I climb slowly, clinging hand-over-hand to the
curving railing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are several
landings en route, and I sometimes pause, but I am eager to get to the top
before anyone else comes; I don&#8217;t want to hold others up again, nor do I want
them to see me so &#8220;weak&#8221; again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I mount
at a steady, slow pace but find it nerve-wracking, mainly when I look up or
down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the top, I sit on the top step
to await the others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There&#8217;s a strong
wind, but I feel safe and protected surrounded by the top of the stair
railing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the others arrive, I
stand up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before I step onto this first
bridge I&#8217;m a bit nervous, but once on the bridge I&#8217;m soon ok, holding the sides
(which are reassuringly more than waist-high and covered with fine mesh) as I
walk, actually moving across the bridge too fast&#8212;not from fear; I&#8217;d like to
have paused, looked around, taken photos.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There will be about 6 more bridges; I seem fine on all of them.</p><p class="MsoNormal">We are in a cloud forest, which Koky explains is wetter than
lower rain forest and dominated by primary growth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hearing others remarking on the fact, I pay attention to the
principle that primary trees host numerous species; this has been pointed out
on other days, but I didn&#8217;t listen closely.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">M wedges ahead of me for a picture opportunity&#8212;very
annoying, especially since here and elsewhere I commonly try not to press
forward while waiting my turn to take pictures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>M is not the only one who does this; it must be some crowd
psychology manifestation, perhaps like filling gaps between cars on a crowded
roadway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After this annoyance, I find
myself having conversations in my head with old enemies and problems that have
gotten in my way or might.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">On the last span we see several howler monkeys in the
treetops beneath us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I enjoy watching
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am less impressed with the
canopy effect than I expected.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sometimes the walkways are below the treetops, sometimes way above (as
much as 150 feet).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps by now I&#8217;ve
just become too jaded and easily distracted by annoyances.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Next up are the zip lines, and Koky says he is going to run
some errands and meet us later in his car.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A little later I see him near the bus, chatting with Ruben.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For some reason I find myself getting
irritated with Koky&#8217;s breaks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I admire
him but do not entirely trust the accuracy of his information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Aside from being very knowledgeable about
the areas he has studied&#8212;less so about the local culture&#8217;s relation to
&#8220;nature&#8221;&#8212;he tells us about his history of alcoholism, how he turned his life around,
how he looks after his children from multiple women; it makes a very powerful
story.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rationally, I think he should
be able to take time off for himself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although he is contracted to be with us all the time, it&#8217;s really
burdensome and not fair for him to be so attentive for two full weeks.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">While the others go on the zip lines for 1 ½ hours, Maxine
and I go to read but end up talking most of the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We realize we haven&#8217;t had much time for such talk; even in our
rooms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think we&#8217;re self-conscious
about what others can hear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But we have
in fact talked, especially about things that are frustrating about the
trip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>E has given me his camera to take
photos of people on the zip line.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am
mildly annoyed because it means I have to be vigilant about not missing them
when they come by a key stretch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maxine
and I sit on a veranda looking towards one long stretch, but it&#8217;s not
comfortable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We go to a park with stone
benches and humming bird feeders, read some, then return early to our
vigil.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When they come by, I try to use
my camera, but it doesn&#8217;t focus easily or snap quickly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I try E&#8217;s camera, which is a dream&#8212;instant
focus and buffered sequential snapshots&#8212;and I think I do well at following
people as they zip by in the distance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>E and others will seem genuinely appreciative of the shots I get.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We go for a late lunch at Stella&#8217;s bakery, apparently run by
Americans.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sandwiches are excellent;
whole place is well designed, airy, good desserts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Others are eager to shop, and after lunch, about 4pm, the bus
takes us to a high-end women&#8217;s artists&#8217; cooperative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A book is on display with names, pictures and bios of the
artists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Things aren&#8217;t cheap, but often
very attractive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, Maxine looks
but buys nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am feeling
enervated and distressed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I am in the early parts of Coates&#8217; <i>Nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></i>We&#8217;re on our own until dinner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maxine and I go to an internet café next to
the hotel&#8217;s property and spend ½ hour each checking e-mail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mom has left no message.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Back in the room we want to rest but have
little time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maxine urges me to phone
Mom regardless of the $1/minute cost, and I don&#8217;t argue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I do think about my mother: &#8220;She&#8217;ll feel
guilty about not have e-mailed me.&#8221;)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
reach her; the operation went fine, seemed to be a success; she says she
thought I said I wouldn't be able to check e-mail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We talk less than one minute.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The bus takes the group to the Mirador for dinner because it
looks onto Arenal and maybe we&#8217;ll see lava flows.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The drive is about 45 minutes, often in fog, over roads that
look impassable for motor vehicles and seem to go through the middle of
nowhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s night, so I can&#8217;t get
perspective on where this hotel-restaurant fits into the landscape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the Mirador the fog is low and we can&#8217;t
see Arenal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inside, they have set
tables end-to-end (I keep thinking of Leonardo&#8217;s <i>Last Supper</i>) so we can
look out the wall-length windows at Arenal&#8212;but of course we can see nothing
more than a few feet into the fog.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
breaks a glass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>E quickly takes charge
of cleaning up, trying to gather all shards.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I offer my headlamp to help spot the shards, but there are so many that
I say, &#8220;Change the tablecloth,&#8221; and E leads that effort by bundling up the
current tablecloth; the staff does not offer a replacement, leaving the table
bare, until someone (must be E) presses for a replacement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Dinner is ok, nothing special; Maxine asks for dry white
wine, what she gets is not so dry, but they won&#8217;t return it &#8220;because she tasted
it.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although annoyed, I have no
interest in making a fuss and say we&#8217;ll pay for it. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Arlene, E and G do their usual pooling of numerous dishes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Of course the drive back i<span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">s as dreary as com</span>ing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maxine and I both feel this was a wasted
trip, since even the food wasn&#8217;t special.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal">I make a general note about the fact that everyone rushes
off the bus to see and photograph practically anything; and on hikes people,
especially M and E, who have the best cameras, rush to film everything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can&#8217;t tell how much this reflects artistic
desires and how much is compulsive tourist behavior.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes these efforts seem mindless to me, though I often join
in (claiming to myself that I&#8217;m looking for either an artistic show or
something I want to be able to remember later).</p></td></tr></tbody></table><big><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span></big><span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0); font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: bold; color: black;">Go to:</span><br></span><a style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;" href="arrivalinstructions.html">Arrival instructions</a><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;" href="https://richardyanowitz.com/costa%20rica%20feb%206-8.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></a><a style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;" href="https://richardyanowitz.com/costa%20rica%20feb%2006-8.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></a><a style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;" href="costaricafeb03-5.html">Feb

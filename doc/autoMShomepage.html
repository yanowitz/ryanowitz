<span style="font-style: italic;">February,
2008</span>
<p>In
mid-summer 1964, at 22, I spent a month with the civil rights project in
Mississippi. &nbsp;I was placed with the largest (and hence safest)
arm of the
project, in Hattiesburg. &nbsp;This section of the web site covers
topics and documents related to my experience there. &nbsp;My only personal comments are on this page and the page that has <a href="MSnewspaper.html">samples from a Hattiesburg daily paper</a>;
the other pages are all documents I include here for historical
purposes, with no comments from me other than summary descriptions.
&nbsp;(Of these, readers might find particular interest in a KKK document
setting forth organizationall "principles" and the longggg and
dismaying&nbsp;<a href="MS_summer1964events.html">catalogue of summer harassment</a>.)</p>
<p>The
project had been well under way when I arrived. &nbsp;I had just
finished a year of master's work in English at Claremont Graduate
School (I would finish the MA program in the fall semester), and I was
a militant supporter of the civil rights movement.&nbsp; At least
one friend
had gone to Mississippi for the project, and I felt a mixture of envy
of him and fear of going. &nbsp;I finally decided that I needed to
go despite my fear
(the three murdered workers, Cheney, Schwerner and Goodman, had
disappeared before I went)--not necessarily for ideal reasons, but
because I felt that if I wanted to be present at what would later be
historically profound, I needed to participate in the project.
&nbsp;Part of the
reason was that I&nbsp; aspired to be a novelist, and the
first-hand experience should be helpful. &nbsp;Still, I certainly
believed whole-heartedly in the cause.</p>
<p>Here is a copy of the time-ravaged 2-page application
form I filled out in late July, apparently in Mississippi (since a
letter reproduced below, en route to Mississippi, is dated earlier).</p>

<p>I phoned my parents in New Jersey to tell
them what I was planning. &nbsp;Old lefties themselves, they seemed
to me frightened and maybe tried to talk me out of going, though in
later years my father, at least, denied this. &nbsp;(When my mother
read that line after I&nbsp;posted this page, she e-mailed me: "I spent an hour on the phone with you when you called trying to
persuade you not to go, e.g. there were safer ways to fight Jim Crow.") &nbsp;It was surely no
help for their equanimity that&nbsp; shortly before I phoned that
day my sister had announced she was pregnant and would be getting
married. &nbsp;I had a rare moment of pride in my father when he
said to me that he told her he wouldn't let her marry Joe unless she
loved him. &nbsp;(She and Joe ended up having two daughters and
divorcing about 10 years later.)</p>
<p>My memory is confused about how I got to Hattiesburg.
&nbsp;This may have been the time I went east after answering a
newspaper ad for someone who was driving that way and wanted a
companion to share gas and driving; or that may have been a year or two
later. &nbsp;If this was the time, the owner of the car, another
young
guy, had family in New Orleans, and we stayed there for a night.</p><p>Here
is a letter (or journal entry?) I wrote en route, presumably in
Colorado--not badly written for a 22-year-old's first draft, though
perhaps self-conscious in its effort at lyricism. &nbsp;I remember none
of what I wrote. &nbsp;My handwriting, thank goodness, was much less
bad than it became over the years since then, especially as I
increasingly came to rely on typewriters and word processing. &nbsp;I'm
not sure&nbsp;who John was (I think he was someone who responded to an
ad I posted for a co-driver to share costs, but perhaps that was a
different cross-country trip), nor the origin of the "kitties." &nbsp;I
owned a cat at some point but would not have been bringing it to
Mississippi.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><img style="width: 704px; height: 916px;" alt="" src="MS%20jpegs/MS_letter%20enroute%20to%20ms%20p1.jpg"></span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 709px; height: 933px;" alt="" src="MS%20jpegs/MS_letter%20enroute%20to%20ms%20p2.jpg"></p><p>However
I got there, I remember feeling great trepidation as I
approached the Mississippi state line from Louisiana. &nbsp;But when we passed the welcome sign at the border, I
relaxed--everything
(of course) seemed normal. &nbsp;How I got to Hattiesburg I also
don't
remember. &nbsp;44 years later, several experiences stick out in my memory.</p>
<p>We had a couple of days of training, including in
non-violent resistance. &nbsp;I remember loving that part of the
training because, intrinsic coward that I was and am, it would now be
the RIGHT thing not to fight. &nbsp;</p>
<p>All of us volunteers were assured that the office phones
were tapped--by the FBI, I think we were told, as opposed to local
police.</p>
<p>As I was walking the streets of Hattiesburg one day with a black
fellow-worker, a pickup truck drove by and a young white guy gave us
the finger and kept going. &nbsp;(Or maybe it was a white
fellow-worker but we were strolling within the black area of town.)
&nbsp;I think we, whistling in the dark, smiled and waved, but
perhaps that is just wishful thinking. &nbsp;In any event, that was
the closest I got to danger during my month in Mississippi.</p>
<p>About the middle of my stay, I flew north to attend my
sister's wedding. &nbsp;In Hattiesburg, two fellow white workers
drove me to the bus station.&nbsp;As we were driving, I realized I
would have to decide whether to go in the white or colored (I assume
that's what it was labeled) entrance. &nbsp;Exiting the car, I
walked slowly, hoping it would drive away. &nbsp;But I could sense
that it had lingered and the occupants were watching. &nbsp;Slowly
I walked up some wooden steps onto a wooden verandah, two doors facing
me just a few feet apart. &nbsp;I walked through the "whites" door.
&nbsp;Inside was one large room. &nbsp;My eyes took in the
ticket counter and the room. &nbsp;An invisible line separated the
two parts, and I walked at a diagonal to cross to the black side of the
counter. &nbsp;I received a glower and prim treatment, but no
unpleasant words. &nbsp;I bought my ticket and sat in the colored
section. &nbsp;I was scared the whole time, but perhaps the bright
lights and the presence of many people reassured me. &nbsp;I
think&nbsp;the waiting blacks avoided looking at me (no less
reasonable a posture than my entering the unknown by the whites door).
&nbsp;I don't remember if the bus itself was segregated, but if so
presumably I sat in the back. &nbsp;I remember being pissed off at
a number of things--that given the actual nature of the station I could
have walked in the colored door, that the two workers in the car
watched me enter the "wrong" door, that I was scared of walking in the
colored door lest something dangerous greet me on the other side, that
the workers in the car hadn't seen what I did as soon as I entered the
room and cased it, that I didn't know what I would have done had there
in fact been some more foreboding&nbsp;separation within the
station. &nbsp;I still don't know what I should have done, though
I'm proud that once in the station I acted as I did.</p>
<p>The bus took me to Jackson, where I boarded a plane north,
whether to one of the New York City airports or Newark I don't
remember. Nor do I remember how I got to my parents' home in New
Brunswick (NJ). &nbsp;Once there, I have a vague memory of walking
around town in a daze, alienated or experiencing dissonance at the
different environment. &nbsp;(My mother adds: "While you were home for the wedding, you said you'd forget where you
were and keep watching your back&nbsp; You also said that you hated to
return to Miss. but you went anyway.") &nbsp;</p><p>At one point,&nbsp;accosted and then pursued by
a panhandler, probably black, after many steps I finally
turned to her and shouted something like, "Leave me alone!" &nbsp;She walked off.
&nbsp;Was I a cheapskate? &nbsp;Too distracted to deal with the
woman? &nbsp;Broke? &nbsp;Unconscious of the irony?
&nbsp;All&nbsp;that and more?</p>
<p>At my sister's wedding, sitting near the back of the
synagogue, I watched her walk down a side aisle, in white, her face
paler than her dress. &nbsp;I don't remember anything further about
my couple of days North, nor about my return to Hattiesburg except that
this time I used the colored doors at the Jackson&nbsp;and
Hattiesburg bus stations. &nbsp;Of course, by now I knew what
the inside of both stations looked like.</p>
<p>In Hattiesburg, we took turns sleeping in the office.
&nbsp;On my night, I lay on the large office desk and struggled to
sleep. &nbsp;At some&nbsp;time like 2 am, the phone rang.
&nbsp;I picked it up with trepidation. &nbsp;A Southern male
voice said, "May I speak to James Chaney?" &nbsp;By that time we
must have known he had been murdered. &nbsp;I imagined bright
headlights screeching up to the front of the office and blinding me
while I was holding the phone.&nbsp; To the caller I said in as
matter-of-fact a voice as I could muster, "I'm sorry, he isn't here."
&nbsp;Perhaps I added, "Why don't you call back in the morning?"
&nbsp;I think I understood that my reaction would fluster the
caller, and indeed he asked a few more times to speak with Chaney,
clearly puzzled that I didn't respond by&nbsp;shouting in rage at
this sacrilege. &nbsp;I maintained the same cordial,
seeking-to-be-helpful voice.</p>
<p>Finally he hung up and I tried to go back to sleep.
&nbsp;A minute later the phone rang again. &nbsp;Same voice.
&nbsp;This time, however, he explained that he was a white student
at the local university and wanted to talk to me about why the project
was there, why outside agitators (the common phrase for Northern civil
rights workers) would intrude on this peaceful town where whites and
Negroes (probably the word he used) had long gotten along just fine
without any outside help. &nbsp;He&nbsp;sounded thoughtful and
curious, albeit disapproving; I like to think that the way I handled
his first call had&nbsp;not only disarmed him but made him follow
up with this conversation. &nbsp;I doubt I did anything to change
his mind at that moment, but I also like to think that our conversation
helped him change over time. &nbsp;Who knows? &nbsp;No matter
what, it was a totally unexpected&nbsp;and, in a sense, gratifying
experience.</p>
<p>On one occasion I got into a conversation with a white
priest volunteer, and before long some statement prompted me to say
that I was an atheist. &nbsp;In a friendly way, he started asking
me why and setting forth the teleological argument for God. &nbsp;I
interrupted (politely, I expect--or hope) and said that I was familiar
with the argument and that anyway faith, of course, wasn't a matter of
reason but of belief. &nbsp; He accepted this and we went on to
other things. &nbsp;My undergraduate degree in philosophy was
paying off--and always has on this point.</p>
<p>I got seriously ill and delerious for a few days at one point.
&nbsp;I don't remember what I ranted about, but I do have an almost
psychedelic memory of the middle-aged, traditional woman, in whose house
I was staying, on her knees beside my bed at least once,
praying for me.&nbsp; A black doctor, a urologist or
gastro-enterologist, from the North I think, treated me and diagnosed
me with an infection (urinary tract?) pertinent to his specialty.
&nbsp;I have always wondered whether, presumably with minimal
equipment at his disposal (I certainly was given no tests), he could
really tell or was falling back on what he knew. &nbsp;I have also
always wondered whether that&nbsp;is a racist thought.</p>
<p>I got very chummy with a black English teacher from
Detroit, much older than I, and at one point when discussing <span style="font-style: italic;">Huckleberry Finn </span>I
asked her how she handled Nigger Jim's name in class. &nbsp;(In 3rd
grade, a black classmate had goaded me into saying the word, which I
had never heard of but could tell from her tone must be rude, and after
learning its meaning I was fanatic about never using it or tolerating
its use by&nbsp;anyone else.<a name="MS_home_note1source"></a><a href="autoMShomepage.html#MS_home_note1">*</a>) &nbsp;Probably finding me both
naive and endearing, she replied, as I recall, that she accepted it
historically, both as usage at the time Twain wrote and as a likely
ironic term that Twain was trying to ridicule by his contrast of the
good Jim with Huck's white-trash (a term I use here for what it evokes,
not for its legitimacy) Pappy.</p><p><a name="MS_mydebateexperience"></a>I
chose a project activity only after I arrived in Mississippi,
and presumably this was common.&nbsp; There were three: registering
blacks to vote, teaching Freedom School, and a third on which I am
blocking. &nbsp;The first, a convoluted process that would made
it&nbsp;nearly impossible for
blacks to register until Congressional passage the next year of the
Voting Rights Act,&nbsp;required volunteers to go
house to house and persuade people to&nbsp;register, then accompany
them to the Registrar's office and help them through the process.
&nbsp;I have a lifetime distaste for selling (though I
have occasionally done it in a form such as soliciting parent donations
for my son's high school debate team), and much as Southern resistance
to black voter registration enraged me, I nonetheless felt incapable of
going up to local people and trying to persuade them to do
something&nbsp;they often were reluctant to do, especially since their
reluctance was likely a
function of fear of physical retribution from which I or the project
would have no way of protecting them.&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever the third option was, I&nbsp;was only comfortable with teaching Freedom School. &nbsp;Judging by&nbsp;<a href="MS-COFOfreedomschoolguide.html">documents I kept about Freedom School</a>,
before&nbsp;leaving home at least
some volunteers had "applied" to teach it and were "accepted."
&nbsp;(Organizers probably did reject people without at least a semblance of
relevant experience.) &nbsp; &nbsp;I don't remember the class options (though the general goal was&nbsp;<a href="MS_whatiscofo.html#MS_COFO_freedomschooldescr">described in a COFO document</a>),
but I chose to coach debate. [Added June, 2010: Glancing at this
document, I see that if I hadn't already been in MS, I would have been
expected to bring a number of school supplies. &nbsp;I don't remember
anyone ever suggesting I go out and get them.]</p><p>I knew virtually nothing about debate (and did not add to this knowledge
during my time in Hattiesburg), though I expect I was aided by at least <a href="MS-COFOfreedomschoolguide.html#MS_debate">one explanatory document</a> distributed to teachers. &nbsp;Presumably I chose it because my
primary teaching concern (not
necessarily primary interest) has always been to develop critical
thinking. &nbsp;25 years later or so, my son was a whiz on his debate
team in Lexington, Mass., but not because I taught him anything about
it.</p><p>I
remember only bits and pieces of the program. &nbsp;I taught my
students, who were junior high and/or early high school age and maybe
all girls, to call each other "my worthy opponent" and generally to be
polite and wait their turns. &nbsp;My general impression now is that
they were all eager to participate but confused about how to argue
ideas with which they disagreed.</p><p>My
group's topic, I remember (I think there
were a few), was whether the civil rights movement should use violence.
&nbsp;I don't know if the creators of this topic had an agenda for one
side or another, though of course the project was rooted in non-violence.
&nbsp;It is&nbsp;possible that the kids were expected to hold a NO
position privately but better understand the reasons for that belief;
it is also possible that, with questions being raised in the movement
about the efficacy of non-violence, the kids were supposed to think
seriously about alternatives.&nbsp; And it is possible that the intent
was, as it was for&nbsp;me (and got me into a lot of trouble when I
later&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><a href="bwhomepage.html">taught in England</a>),
to hone the mind's analytical abilities and to identify with other
points of view without having to support&nbsp;them. &nbsp;I have long believed
that seeing the
ambiguity in moral issues is healthy, although I have never inferred
from that principle that one shouldn't choose sides or that one side
isn't better than another. &nbsp;And from a different perspective, it
had to be good for the kids to get practice feeling comfortable about
public presentation.</p><p>I pressed my students
to think carefully about both (are there ever only two?) sides of the
issue, and in at least one debate (I think they had a few, though I
don't remember whether they were with other Hattiesburg kids or kids
from other towns) they had to take the
pro-violence side and did a good job with it. By the time I was leaving
Mississippi&nbsp;a month later, one of my better students told me,
"Before we did this, I thought I knew what I believed, but now I'm not
sure." &nbsp;</p>From time to time I think back on this experience and
wonder what became of the kids, who would be in their 50s now and
perhaps even grandparents.<p>Here's a cover perhaps created
by one of my students for class material, perhaps&nbsp;created by some other student for some handout in the summer project.</p>

(presumably straight back to Claremont), but while it may not hold the profound
place in US history that I anticipated, I have always been glad I
joined the project, and the experience has remained a part of my life.</p><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><a name="MS_home_note1"></a><a href="autoMShomepage.html#MS_home_note1source">*</a>After
I posted this parenthesis, my mother e-mailed me: "Did you stop to
think why you had never heard 'nigger?'&nbsp; Once, Mrs.
Ernst [wife of our family doctor] had a friend in her car when she
dropped Doris off to play.&nbsp; Judi
was sunburned and fairly dark, causing the friend to tell&nbsp;her she
"looked like a little nigger."&nbsp; Judi stood there unmoved and I
maliciously explained that my daughter hadn't the faintest idea what
she was talking about, that it was the first time she'd ever heard the
word."

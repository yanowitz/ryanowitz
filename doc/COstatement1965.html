the Vietnam War I was a draft dodger--that is, I determined to avoid
getting drafted. &nbsp; I made sure my passport was up to date, and I
took student deferments every year. &nbsp;</p><p>In the anti-war
movement, this was a virtue. &nbsp;For much of the rest of the country,
it was at best cowardly and at worst a willingness to let other young
men die in my place. &nbsp;(As I write, it has been fashionable for
some years for many to look back on that war, however morally wrong it
is now viewed, and extol service in the war. &nbsp;That is, avoiders of
that draft still get a bad press.) &nbsp;I was certainly scared of
fighting or getting killed, and even before Vietnam I sensed that with
my propensity to challenge authority&nbsp;I wouldn't last long in the
military; but I also believed (perhaps partly but certainly not wholly
out of convenience) the US was fighting an immoral war and that
refusing to fight was an act of moral rectitude. &nbsp;I have never
believed in patriotism, and love to quote that great conservative mind,
Samuel Johnson, that "patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel."
&nbsp;I believed that most of the young men serving in the war were
dupes of our government, and I like to think that I did not approve of
harassing vets who returned home. &nbsp;(This is probably true because
it would&nbsp;echo&nbsp;what I do remember clearly:&nbsp;that despite
the frequent, appalling antagonism of&nbsp;police to the
Movement--whatever that was, exactly--I never felt comfortable with
fellow lefties calling them "pigs.")</p><p>I also didn't buy fellow
left-wingers extolling of the Viet Cong or the North Vietnamese regime,
but I did view the North as a lesser evil than the often corrupt and
always right-wing South Vietnamese governments. &nbsp;(Readers may
recall that the US has long had a propensity to back "friendly" regimes
regardless of their politics against "enemy" regimes, which in those
days were anything that called themselves communist and today anything
our leaders choose to label "terrorist.") &nbsp;One of the less
palatable arguments to support North Vietnam was that because Vietnam
was a single country, the North could not be invading the South--that
is, it could not be invading its own country. &nbsp;I did have the
nerve to burn my draft card (though I admired those who did); I was
terrified of any action that would send me to prison.</p><p>Until 1965,
when I turned 25, if you had student deferments you were, for practical
purposes, draft-proof once you were 26. &nbsp;That year, however, a new
draft law was enacted that created a draft lottery (you were called up
according to your birthday, and birthdays were randomly sequenced for a
given year). &nbsp;In addition, those who received any student
deferments after passage of the law would go into the lottery up to the
age of 35.</p><p>If you believed in the draft, this was certainly a
fairer way of taking kids and minimizing manipulation, principled or
cynical, of the rules to avoid the war. &nbsp;As a wily young guy, I
devised the following scheme to avoid going into the lottery. &nbsp;It
worked.</p><p>When the law passed, I was a grad student at Berkeley and
had a student deferment under the old dispensation that would last
until September. My 26th birthday was the following February. &nbsp;So
from my point of view I had to avoid getting a student deferement in
September but string out my draft ineligibility for another five
months. &nbsp;The following timetable is approximate.</p><p>First, when
I registered for coursework in September, I did not request a student
deferement. &nbsp;As I expected, it took awhile for my draft board in
South Jersey--let's guess late September or sometime in October.
&nbsp;I received a notice that I was reclassified as 1-A (immediate
draft eligibility). &nbsp;I think I had 30 days from the date of
re-classification to appeal. &nbsp;Sojust before the deadline,  I sent
out my appeal to be classified as a CO.&nbsp;Probably what happened was
that I then received papers to apply for this classification
(which&nbsp;would explain why I refer to "3 days" in my statement
below, though it possible that I just&nbsp;procrastinated.) &nbsp; After I submitted this statement there
would be another long delay while my draft board got around to
rejecting it. &nbsp;(I assumed they didn't read much of the statement,
if any at all; I should have put at the beginning the closing punch
line&nbsp;requesting the board members to resign in the face of my
compelling arguments....) &nbsp;I then had at least one appeal of the
rejection, which offered another 30-day window, then that appeal had to
be rejected. &nbsp;Perhaps there were&nbsp; even more ways of delaying.
&nbsp;In any event, I easily passed my 26th birthday while all this
back-and-forth went on.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Footnote</span>:
Although I have met plenty of Vietnam veterans (many of whom are quite
cynical about their service) since then, at the time I knew no one at
all who went to Vietnam. &nbsp;The pilot husband of a teaching
colleague was killed when his plane was shot down, and I went to the
funeral out of respect for her; this was the closest I came to death
from the war. &nbsp;I was far more insulated from its effects that many
(presumably most) Americans. &nbsp;I don't know why that is so, though
it is quite plausible it had to do with my being in the Bay Area and
hanging primarily&nbsp;with counter-culture types.<br></p></td></tr></tbody></table><span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;"><a name="CO_statement"></a><br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"></span><img style="width: 800px;

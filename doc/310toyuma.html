<p class="MsoNormal"><i style="font-style: italic;"></i><span style="font-style: italic;">February 5, 2008</span><br></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">As a member of the Screen Actors Guild, early each year I
receive from some studies DVDs of movies nominated for SAG awards; they're hoping I watch the movie and vote for it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Used
to be I, with my partner, could get in free to cinemas to see nominated movies,
but over the years that perk has disappeared.)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The savings on movie tickets provided by the DVDs doesn&#8217;t offset the
cost of my SAG dues (especially since I&#8217;ve usually paid to see some of the
movies already), which I keep up for no good reason; but&nbsp;it feels as though I&#8217;m
getting <i>something</i> in return.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This year, one of the DVDs&nbsp;was <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/310_to_yuma/"><i>3:10 to Yuma</i></a>&nbsp;with Russell Crowe (as Ben Wade, a
gang leader) and Christian Bale (Dan Evans, a rancher and sharpshooter in debt
to local, thuggish citizens) in the lead roles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m curious why the film got so
much hype.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly the acting and photography are fine, but the plot
is often silly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the film has some gritty and
disturbingly ruthless scenes (21st century measures of cinematic
greatness?), it is a throwback to westerns with which I grew up (and on
which I doted) in the '50s and before&#8212;and I don&#8217;t mean that in a nostalgic,
approving way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For neither better nor
worse, the film has little blood despite considerable violence, the way
gangster movies and war movies and westerns used to pretend that killing was
neat and bloodless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I should note that
I don&#8217;t take well to the more modern trend towards graphic violence, though I recognize
that it is not always gratuitous.)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is plenty of killing, especially by one particularly psychopathic
comrade of Ben&#8217;s, Charlie Prince (played by Ben Foster).</p>





<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>Early in the film, Ben is captured by
law enforcement types because, after tricking local law enforcement to leave
town so he can rip off town businesses, he lingers in a whorehouse in mutually
happy and more-or-less tender sexual union with a sex worker whom he has sort of known in the past.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(This is what has come to pass for a romantic
subplot, I suppose.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To pay off his
debts, Dan agrees to join several others to transport Ben a few days&#8217; ride to a
prison train that will stop at the town of Contention (!)&#8212;the 3:10 to Yuma
(which, in one of the scattered clever bits in the film, turns out to be a bit
late).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Along the way, Ben escapes a
couple of times and is re-captured. Dan&#8217;s angry 14-year-old son disobeys his father and follows
the group so that at one point (<span style="font-style: italic;">quelle surprise</span>!) he is able to save its members when Ben has gotten the drop
on them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are supposed to admire the
son&#8217;s rebellious behavior, though not the reasons he is angry. &nbsp;One by one,&nbsp;nearly the entire escort gets killed off,
starting with one of the town thugs who helped burn down Dan&#8217;s barn at the start of the
film.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For reasons never fully
explained, Ben has taken a liking to Dan&#8212;so much so that at the climax of the
film he performs a deed that seems thoroughly out of character, albeit that the
film has gradually prepared us not to be very surprised at what happens.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">There are confusing gunfights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One is at night, another throwback to the 50s&#8217; westerns I
remember from childhood with, as my father, using a <i>Mad </i>magazine term,
dubbed it, &#8220;another furshlugginer night scene&#8221; in which it was impossible to
make out much of the action; presumably in this re-make the effect is supposed
to be artistic (for example, here and there flashes of light from gunfire
illuminate the scene for a second or so), but if so the script writers and/or
director (James Mangold) need to work harder at distinguishing between art and
obfuscation.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal">The most ridiculous moments are when the people we are
rooting for (not always the best guys) are managing to evade gunfire from worse
guys who at any other time could close their eyes, spin around several times,
and without pausing shoot a hole through a penny at a thousand yards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
carnage becomes especially extensive
because the psychotic Charlie Prince, in another clever script moment,
offers
$200 (the same payment Dan is supposed to get if he delivers Ben to the
train) to Contention townfolk for each member they kill&nbsp;of Ben&#8217;s
remaining
escort.<span style="">&nbsp; We are creating here&nbsp;that part of
classical tragedy which treats "ordinary" people as disposable.
&nbsp;We know nothing about the townspeople other than the crude image
they present,&nbsp;we are invited to project unworthy character traits
onto them, and when they are mown down we give no thought to them as
dying human beings. &nbsp;I experienced them as kin to
australopithicenes,&nbsp;grunting in excitement at the prospect of an
easy $200 and able to handle firearms&nbsp;with so little proficiency
that one wonders why they keep pressing forward, lemming-like, before
Dan's&nbsp;sure fire (aided no end by his invisible cornucopia of
ammunition in weapons that never seem to need reloading).</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""></span>Not
long after the $200 bounty offer, we become&nbsp;spectators to an
American western&nbsp;version of popular kung-fu movie battles of
recent years, just as frenetic and just as cartoonish. &nbsp;Without
giving&nbsp;much more away, I&#8217;ll note that by the end
of the movie we are witnessing a state of affairs not unlike the end of
<i>Hamlet</i>
but with no Fortinbras to pick up the pieces.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My opening
bemusement at why this film has been hyped should probably be shifted to asking what need(s) the plot devices fulfill in today&#8217;s
audiences to earn the movie wide critical and audience praise.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><a href="310toyuma.html#topofpage">Top of page</a><br>Back to&nbsp;<a href="entertainment.html">Entertainment reviews</a> page<br><a href="index.html"><b>HOME PAGE</b></a><span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold; background-color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"></span></body></html>

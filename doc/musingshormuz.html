<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span class="published-content-body"><font face="Times New Roman">George W. Bush's goal of elevating the  Iran  threat (<strong><span class="media_outlet">New York Times</span></strong>, <a target="_blank" href="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=bbXeJ8hfYfn%2FntYN6w1N147ibq42vLEc" title="">1/8/08</a>)
got a major boost last week from the news media, who failed to question
the Pentagon's alarmist account of an encounter between U.S. and
Iranian boats. <br>
<br>
On January 6 in the Strait of Hormuz, the entrance to the Persian Gulf,
U.S. Navy ships were approached by five small speedboats, allegedly
affiliated with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. After some radio
communication, the Iranian boats turned away.<br>
<br>
Overwhelmingly, U.S. media took the White House's alarmist version of these events at face value. The <span class="media_outlet"><strong>L.A. Times</strong></span> (<a target="_blank" href="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=B%2BGQM7b85zwL8YCa6uh8Z47ibq42vLEc" title="">1/8/08</a>) reported: </font></span></font></font></font></font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span class="published-content-body">
<div class="sideindent"><font face="Times New Roman">Officials said the
boats came within 200 yards of the warships and radioed the Americans.
"They said something like, 'I am coming at you and you will explode,'"
a military official said. "That is overt aggression."</font></div>
</span></font></font></font></font></blockquote>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3"><span class="published-content-body"><font face="Times New Roman"> Corporate media sometimes reported the official claims as fact. <strong><span class="media_outlet">CNN</span></strong>'s Kyra Philipps (<strong><span class="media_outlet">CNN Newsroom</span></strong>,
1/7/08) summed up this "high drama in the high seas": "Five Iranian
boats threaten three U.S. ships in international waters. One even
radioed that the U.S. ship would soon explode."<br>
<br>
<strong><span class="media_outlet">NPR</span></strong> host Renee Montagne (<strong><span class="media_outlet">Morning Edition</span></strong>,
1/8/08) reported that "a group of Iranian boats charged and threatened
American warships on their way into the Persian Gulf." Meanwhile, <strong><span class="media_outlet">PBS</span> </strong>Anchor Jim Lehrer reported (1/7/08), "The Iranians warned the ships they'd blow up, and then dropped boxes into the water."<br>
<br>
The proof the media offered to support these claims was a Pentagon
video, broadcast on all major TV networks, that depicted some small
boats approaching a U.S. Navy ship. A radio transmission could be heard
in which a voice made a threatening statement.<br>
<br>
Following the White House line, the media represented the incident as a
dramatic close call that could have led to a violent escalation. <strong><span class="media_outlet">ABC News</span></strong>
anchor Charles Gibson (1/8/08) reported that "President Bush called it
a provocative act. And the Navy video would indicate that's something
of an understatement." And a <span class="media_outlet"><strong>New York Times</strong> editorial (</span><a target="_blank" href="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=gavo1XFg85gxEIwi2dFuKY7ibq42vLEc" title="">1/9/08</a>)
chastised Iran for having "played a reckless and foolish game in the
Strait of Hormuz this week that--except for American restraint--could
have spun lethally out of control."<br>
<br>
After Iran released its own video recording of the event--which showed
a more routine exchange between the U.S. and Iranian vessels--the
Pentagon distanced itself from the claim that the Iranian boats had
issued a verbal threat. Three days after its original report citing
unnamed officials who implied the threat had been issued from the
boats, the <strong><span class="media_outlet">L.A. Times</span> </strong>(<a target="_blank" href="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=qGSBvdC70SzPZRw%2FLFyjT%2BuUQ%2BJNV7hU" title="">1/11/08</a>)
"clarified" that a key part of the official version of events was
inaccurate: "Clarifying earlier accounts, officials said Thursday that
they did not know whether a radio call in which a voice threatened to
'explode' the U.S. ships came from the small boats or whether it came
from another source." Retreating from the account that definitely
attributed the transmission to the speedboats, the officials now said
only that "the radio threat was received at the same time as the
encounter with the Iranian boats." <br>
<br>
U.S. officials conceded that the Navy's video of the speedboats and the
audio of the threat were discrete recordings that had been spliced
together through editing. <strong><span class="media_outlet">New York Times</span></strong> correspondent Nazila Fathi (<a target="_blank" href="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=Whj6LHtp5gEM53u6yEDbL47ibq42vLEc" title="">1/10/08</a>) wrote:</font>     <br>

raised the possibility that the voice featured in the video was a
maritime heckler, well-known to American ships operating in the Middle
East, "who listens in on ship-to-ship radio traffic and then jumps on
the net shouting insults and epithets."<br>
<br>
Moreover, the media's portrait of the Strait of Hormuz incident as a
dramatic confrontation seemed to be contradicted by U.S. Navy Commander
Vice Admiral Kevin Cosgriff's statement (<a target="_blank" href="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=g%2BD81tBgIgmhexJbC8mOe47ibq42vLEc" title="">1/7/08</a>)
in response to a question about the potential damage these small boats
could have caused: "They had neither anti-ship missiles nor torpedoes.
And I wouldn't characterize the posture of the U.S. 5th Fleet as
'afraid' of these ships or these three U.S. ships 'afraid' of these
small boats." <br>
<br>
For all of the uncertainty that remains about the January 6 incident,
one thing that was certain was that one of the goals of George W.
Bush's trip to the Mideast was to elevate the threat posed by Iran. On
January 8, Bush stated (<strong><span class="media_outlet">New York Times</span></strong>, <a target="_blank" href="http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/dia/track.jsp?v=2&amp;c=bD4Nd6KjO6O8OLGW4S0kII7ibq42vLEc" title="">1/9/08</a>)
his intent to "remind" allies in the Persian Gulf that "Iran was a
threat, Iran is a threat, and Iran will continue to be a threat if they
are allowed to learn how to enrich uranium.'' <br>
<br>
How convenient, then, that this incident--which happened just as Bush's
trip got underway--appeared to offer "further evidence that Iran is
unpredictable and remains a threat," as a Pentagon spokesperson told <strong><span class="media_outlet">CNN</span></strong> (1/7/08).</font></span></font></font></font></font></p></td></tr></tbody></table><a href="musingshormuz.html#topofpage">Top of page</a><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Back to <a href="musingsandmeanderingshomepage.html">Social and political comments</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;page</span><br><a href="index.html"><b>HOME PAGE</b></a></body></html>

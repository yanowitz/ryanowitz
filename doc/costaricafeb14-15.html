<p class="MsoNormal"><b style=""><i>Day 11 &amp; 12
(Feb. 14 &amp; 15)</i></b><i> Early in the morning we&#8217;ll depart Puerto Jiminez
for the end of the road at Carate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is an adventure just to get to our lodge, a remote paradise literally past the
end of the road, across rivers and up steep mountains. Luna Lodge was recently
featured in Conde Naste Traveller, and was rated &#8220;One of the Top 25 Eco-Lodges
in the World&#8221; by Travel &amp; Leisure Magazine, and it has earned its
reputation<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-- you won&#8217;t want to leave
this place!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But if you should, we&#8217;ll
hike deep into Corcovado National Park and enjoy the rainforest, wide open
beaches and remote trails.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Corcovado is sure to be a highlight of your adventure.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Over 30 acres of Luna Lodge's property is primary virgin
rain forest, where not only can you spot literally hundreds of rare and
beautiful bird species such as the scarlet macaw, red-legged honeycreeper, and
slaty tailed trogon, but also many mammals including several endangered
species. The endangered Harpy Eagle was recently seen flying overhead for the
first time in many years. There are five year-round waterfalls on the property
itself, one of them less than five minutes walk from the cabins with a swift
flowing chute and refreshing wading pool. Two nights at Luna Lodge</i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">While Maxine goes down to wash I put out her card.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She has a sweet one for me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>6:40 we walk to a long beach nearby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Others are there and have seen macaws 10
minutes earlier, one of the sights I would particularly have enjoyed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Breakfast is good but has no non-herbal
tea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pancakes have corn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I try gently to ask if they have only this
one kind, and Koky asks the chef to prepare plain ones for me.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We leave late.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
town my book is not at the relevant office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Koky makes some calls; we go to the dock where we landed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The boat is in the water maybe 20 yards from
the dock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Someone is supposed to be
here but isn&#8217;t.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another boat happens to
be coming in, and Koky asks for a ride.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He gets to the boat, reaches in the storage area for a minute, then stands
up with his arm raised and my book apparently in it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was already feeling much less bad, and this greatly lifts my
spirits (helped by the realization, when Koky returns to the dock, that I had
also left the little tape recorder there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All this probably takes 30-40 minutes, but no one complains, and I
think: &#8220;don&#8217;t feel bad; I&#8217;ve been tolerant of concerns important to others, and
this book is an important concern of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We drive off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
dirt road is not bad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have a rest
stop and head for the side-trip to a reserve.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although I&#8217;d been dreading the side trip, most of the time it isn&#8217;t at
all bad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We eat on a beach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Temperature is fairly comfortable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We see a macaw or two and a whole tribe of
howlers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then we hike awhile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I realize I do not want to do this&#8212;would
rather sit on the beach and read&#8212;and ask Koky how much longer; I stress that it
is not to get the others to turn around.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He says only a very short distance further, so I stay with the
group.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the hike is over within
a minute or so and we return to the van.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">With one or two more stops to see macaws and monkeys by the
road, we proceed to Luna Lodge.<span style="">&nbsp;</span>I nap
20 minutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Last 10 minutes of trip is
very rough terrain, much of it uphill, and includes fording several times what
is probably the same twisting river (I am told that in rainy season the river
can back traffic for hours).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Luna is beautiful but limited and very expensive&#8212;US prices
for booze, $25 for unspecified &#8220;bottle of wine.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The generator will go off about 10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(The literature says when everyone goes to bed, but we later
learn this actually means about 10.)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Lighting in the room is very poor after dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cabin is lovely with an &#8220;outdoor&#8221; (sheltered but with an open
wall) toilet/shower.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We turn in some
laundry (twice the cost of elsewhere).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I shower and feel much better.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We sit in rockers on the cabin porch, which overlooks a valley.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We get the impression that, despite Josh&#8217;s
assurances, there is little to do here&#8212;certainly little that we would like to
do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maxine and I have decided not to go
on tomorrow&#8217;s all-day 12-km hike.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Koky tells us that at Josh&#8217;s instruction he has arranged a
simple hike for Thursday around the local lagoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We flush shit toilet paper against the rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appetizers (turns out to be a single
appetizer) are at 6 each evening, dinner at 7.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Tonight is chips and bean dip.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Maxine thinks this is to encourage bar orders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dinner is a buffet; I like almost all the veggie dishes, but the
chicken seems dry and I leave it after tasting it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Others agree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m in a
good mood, joking again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have all
agreed to spring for a puddlejumper plan instead of the long bus ride to San
Jose, and Koky tell us he is leaving tomorrow (Wed.) afternoon&#8212;would have
stayed with us if we had stayed with the plan to take the bus on Friday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maxine thinks $300 is a good tip; I think it
should be a little more.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Electricity is off between 10 and 7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In our room is a bat (we saw many of them
flitting earlier in the twilight) and numerous bugs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We huddle with our headlamps beneath the netting over the
bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our calves have been bitten up
earlier (&#8220;no mosquitoes&#8221; an employee had reassured us in the afternoon&#8212;but had
not warned of other biting insects).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the room we read awhile, readjust (with difficulty) the netting over the bed,
go to sleep before 10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I feel terrified
of getting up and back into bed lest I be unable to adjust the netting again,
and I resolve not to pee during the night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Slight trouble getting to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It&#8217;s a bit muggy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At 1:15 Maxine
gets up to pee, and I follow through the open netting on her side of the
bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hard to get back to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I obsess with narratives about ecological
issues, especially the fraud of this lodge, but I do get to sleep until 5:55,
when I am up for the day.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I think: the lodge is an ecoDisney with bugs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bugs are annoying but no true
danger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The builder, someone said, is
an ex-California hippie (and the library includes some new age type books plus
books on natural medicine).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our
introductory blurb/leaflet has stressed ecological actions (e.g., toilet paper
in basket), but why did the owner choose to clear part of the rain forest for a
tourist lodge?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I will learn later that
this isn&#8217;t exactly what happened.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why
use so much (seemingly) fancy wood for construction?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why charge premium prices?<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g309280-d301435-r4497723-Luna_Lodge-Carate_Osa_Province_of_Puntarenas.html">My review of Luna (posted on tripadvisor.com)</a><i style=""><o:p></o:p></i></p>



<p class="MsoNormal"><comment title="[if !supportEmptyParas]" xmlns="http://disruptive-innovations.com/zoo/nvu"></comment><b>Feb 15, Wednesday</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Upon waking I see big gaps in the netting at our feet and on
Maxine&#8217;s side of the bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I feel good
to have the whole day to read.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maxine
is up 20 minutes after me.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The other 4 women have gone on the all-day hike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>G joins us mid-way through breakfast (fruit,
granola; I have a decent cheese omelet), and I soon go to a hammock on the
terrace adjoining the dining area.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Maxine stays and chats with G.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
repress the need to respond to another of G&#8217;s cheery, confident observations;
he will always top you and drag out what you've said.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I read some of Coates, nap in the hammock for an hour, read
some more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I feel largely at peace,
though a little tension remains in my chest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Very nice breeze as I read (and write diary entries).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A pool is being built next to the
lodge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yesterday a noisy earth mover
was there when we arrived; today the workers make a little noise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By mid-afternoon I am walking very slowly (feeling peaceful,
unhurried).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have minimal contact with
G, who by now has probably picked up on my disapproval/reluctance to talk with
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By 5 I have had a relaxed day with
some insect bites.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The plans for tomorrow&#8217;s lagoon hike are still unclear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We pay Koky our bills ($119 for drinks and
extras, $300 tip for Koky), and we have about $340 left of the $1200 cash with
which we started plus $50 in colons for the ATM in Santa Elena.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">From our porch in late afternoon we see a yellow-beaked
toucan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nifty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dinner includes mahi-mahi, which I find I
like as it has been prepared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
the first meal without Koky, though the staff have set a place for him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Back at the room after dinner I realize there is no
comfortable place to read, especially at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The couch in the lodge stinks.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So we sit again on our little room porch on leather rocking chairs, then
try to read under the netting (bugs are attracted to our lights&#8212;and I probably
use my headlamp because room lighting is poor).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It gets hot under the netting, and we return to the rockers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I read with the headlamp, go to bed just
before 10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Very wired, get irritated
with the difficulty of draping the netting correctly, angry with the bug
problem.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I feel (1) at the mercy of Josh&#8217;s Innerquest (his
&#8220;philosophy&#8221; linked to his business) consciousness, that this leads him to
deciding what is best for his travelers (and his &#8220;go-with-the-flow&#8221; is
self-serving) and (2) that the lodge deliberately narrows your scope to what
the owner thinks is good for you&#8212;poor lighting, walls open to bugs, generator
out 10-7.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><a style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;" href="arrivalinstructions.html"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: bold; color: black;">Go to:</span><br></a><a style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;" href="arrivalinstructions.html">Arrival instructions</a><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"> &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><a style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;" href="https://richardyanowitz.com/costa%20rica%20feb%206-8.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></a><a style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;" href="https://richardyanowitz.com/costa%20rica%20feb%2006-8.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></a><a style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;" href="costaricafeb03-5.html">Feb

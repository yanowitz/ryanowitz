					<description><![CDATA[I spent a year as an infantryman in Vietnam (1968-69). I knew the war was wrong and that I should have gone to Canada (or prison). The reasons I didn&#039;t are complicated, but I carry quite a bit of guilt over that. I respect everyone who did manage to &#039;dodge&#039; that draft. It was the right choice. In my experience, most of the young men I served with started out not questioning the war, but most of them had their eyes opened while in country. When I got out, just about everyone who knew I&#039;d been there treated me well--but they were my friends. I was never in a position to be mistreated by others who opposed the war, but have the distinct impression that there really were few instances of such mistreatment--by 1970 most on the left supported the soldiers as victims of the war. Almost all of my working class friends wound up serving. Almost all of my middle class friends managed to avoid the draft.]]></description>

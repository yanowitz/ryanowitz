Until recently, my own posts seemed routinely approved. Then, a couple of days ago, I offered my post on re-opening schools and was greeted by an apparently new general announcement that the site would not accept criticisms of politicians it (whoever constitutes \u201cit\u201d) supports. I then wrote the following (slightly edited here), to which I\u2019ve received no reply.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>What has happened to progressive standards of free (civil) speech and open debate? It\u2019s one thing to require reliable sources for a claim or demand civil exchanges (I\u2019ve seen far too many social media vitriolic attacks even from people with whom I like to think I share political goals); it\u2019s another to reject civil disagreements because someone or a cadre of people doesn\u2019t like them.<\/p>\n<p>This (new?) standard reminds of the sectarianism and dogma that has appalled me all my life on the political left. And how does it differ from the kind of behavior we hate in our enemies?<\/p>\n<p>When I signed onto this group (because I wanted to see what other progressives in CT were thinking during the Trump years), did I fail to see that the group is a bastion for selecting and then protecting the \u201cright\u201d candidates? What will constitute a violation of this rule? Criticism of Joe Manchin? Of moderate, non-progressive Democrats? Will non-Democrats not be allowed (in which case, please let me know so I can withdraw)? Indeed, is this a Democratic Party site?<\/p>\n<p>Did I miss an open consultation of members of this group about enacting this policy? How exactly was the decision made?<\/p>\n<p>And who moderates a moderator\u2019s decisions?<\/p>\n<p>Is constructive criticism (which I hope this is, though I\u2019m sure my anger peeks through my formal prose) no longer a value?<\/p>\n<p>Will this post itself be censored?<br \/>\nd onto this group (because I wanted to see what other progressives in CT were thinking during the Trump years), did I fail to see that the group is a bastion for selecting and then protecting the \u201cright\u201d candidates?

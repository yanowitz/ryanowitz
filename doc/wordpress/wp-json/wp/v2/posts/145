Though Judaism itself does not\nhave a notion of Original Sin, the so-called Protestant ethic (not, of course,\nembraced by every Christian or even Protestant) can penetrate our thinking as\nwe mimic the English vernacular from elders (and often peers) steeped in older\nusage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Never\nunderestimate the power of language usage to affect even the best of us. We may\nthink we&#8217;re liberated from narrow thinking embedded in connotations, but\nsomewhere in us our consciously desired beliefs may not be quite as morally\nunambiguous as we&#8217;d like to think.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>*For one interesting account\nof its history, see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.word-detective.com\/2013\/02\/are-you-decent\/?wpmp_tp=1\">http:\/\/www.word-detective.com\/2013\/02\/are-you-decent\/?wpmp_tp=1<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>**A large subset of us presumably\ngives a pass to intimate partners, though perhaps only during intimate moments.\nThis aspect of the issue gets very complicated and includes issues of\nembarrassment about whether one\u2019s body will be appealing to others. I have no\nidea of how common it is to turn lights out before one gets naked\u2014not too\ncommon, I would guess. To the degree one takes the Garden of Eden story\nseriously and even literally, I would imagine that Adam\u2019s and Eve\u2019s\nembarrassment should be a model for one\u2019s own treatment of nudity even with an\nintimate partner\u2014or at least during times when we\u2019re not being intimate. (Reproduction\nis, after all, prescribed as part of our \u201cpunishment.\u201d) I don\u2019t know the\nhistory of dealing with physicians\u2019 seeing one\u2019s nakedness\u2014and I would guess\nit&#8217;s especially relevant for women giving birth\u2014but it\u2019s probably revealing.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Are you decent?

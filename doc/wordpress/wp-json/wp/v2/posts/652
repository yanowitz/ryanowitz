So far as I can tell, my discomfort has had little to do with fear of anti-semitism (though I\u2019ve encountered it).<\/p>\n<p>Both sets of my grandparents were immigrants to the US\u2014coincidentally from Lithuania (grandmothers) and Romania (grandfathers) near the turn of the 20<sup>th<\/sup> century. My father\u2019s mother kept kosher. She also kept being deserted by her apparently frequently unfaithful husband who, as my father tells it, returned from time to time to get her pregnant before gadding off again<a name=\"_ftnref1\"><\/a><a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]<\/a>. I don\u2019t know for sure, but I don\u2019t think my mother was brought up in a kosher home. All the surviving children of the first American generation on both sides became pretty secular.<\/p>\n<p>We lived in the Bronx until I was four, and then my father used money provided by the GI Bill,<a name=\"_ftnref2\"><\/a><a href=\"#_ftn2\">[2]<\/a> as I always remember calling it, to buy a chicken farm (the first of two) in South Jersey (the first of two). As an adult, I have enjoyed startling people when I say I grew up on a chicken farm, and I still know how to tell whether a hen is a good layer.<\/p>\n<p>From then through high school, I lived in a largely Christian culture that I think was heavily weighted towards Catholicism. When I was around 10 years old, I can remember sitting on the piano bench (supposedly focused on practicing) and mentally wrestling with whether some God existed (implicitly monotheistic\u2014I probably knew about Greek and Roman gods, but I\u2019m sure I accepted their treatment as out-of-date, childish beliefs), and I have the vague sense that this dilemma was really about whether there was any reason I should think such an amorphous idea (to the extent I had any idea about it) fit into the world I was experiencing. My very vague memory is that I was puzzled with why people held such a belief. Perhaps that confusion was driven in part by morning bible-readings and recitation of the Lord\u2019s Prayer in the one-room schoolhouse I attended through third grade.<\/p>\n<p>So far as I can remember, these required morning exercises (all the way through high school?) had no context for me. I can&#8217;t remember knowing anything about what was in the bible; I think my only &#8220;study&#8221; of it has been related to adult interest in history of ideas. As an undergraduate philosophy major, I encountered many Western, mostly Christian, arguments for a divine being, but I think treated them all as historical relics with value only for what they revealed about how much effort could go into making hopeless (though not therefore useless) arguments.<\/p>\n<p>As a child, I was uncomfortable in the presence of various relatives, seemingly steeped in Old World Jewish culture, from my grandfather\u2019s and step-grandmother\u2019s generation, most of whom lived in Brooklyn. They often spoke Yiddish, which I neither understood nor (I can now regret) wanted to learn (though through my adult life I have surprised myself at knowing and even using the odd Yiddishism here and there). Other than my mother\u2019s parents, I don\u2019t remember meeting equivalent relatives on that side of the family (though I probably did meet my mother\u2019s grandfather in his 100s and with little time left to live).<\/p>\n<p>No doubt I felt pressure (perhaps gentle; I don\u2019t remember) to connect with the immigrant mishpocha (I had to look up that spelling, and there are orthographic variants). I found these relatives strange, from a world with which I felt no identity. It wasn\u2019t just that they often spoke Yiddish or that their English typically proceeded with rhythmic up-and-down cadence that tended to end sentences with a rising question mark, but that the way they addressed me, the way they talked about things, the way they dressed, the narrowness of what they seemed to care about\u2014probably other features, too\u2014all felt\u2026foreign? Unacceptable? Embarrassing? Definitely embarrassing. I wanted no part of this strange culture, and while I loved visiting New York City to get away from the chicken farm, I couldn&#8217;t wait to leave the presence of these relatives. Though 2<sup>nd<\/sup>-generation American, I probably felt similarly to many 1<sup>st<\/sup>-generation Jewish (and other immigrants\u2019) children who wanted to seem like their \u201cnormal\u201d schoolmates.<\/p>\n<p>At three years old, I was too young to grasp what had happened in Nazi Germany when news emerged of allied discovery and liberation of concentration camps, but it couldn&#8217;t have been more than a couple of years later when that horror entered my consciousness. (Only much later in life did I learn that the camps and their execution counterparts killed millions of non-Jews.) Except for the reality of the Holocaust, I might have abandoned any Jewish identity, but because of it I feel I would be a traitor of some kind to an historical tradition of evil treatment that hasn\u2019t ended. I\u2019ll likely be writing more about that influence, but for now I\u2019ll mention these powerful effects:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The underpinning of my attitudes about social justice throughout my life (as in asking myself, \u201cUsing as an antithetical guideline the immoral behavior of those Germans who looked the other way under Hitler, what choice should I be making in response to such-and-such moral outrage I\u2019m currently witnessing?\u201d).<\/li>\n<li>Frequent but not nightly nightmares well into my adult years that I called my \u201cconcentration camp dreams.\u201d Only occasionally was I literally in such a camp, but routinely I was trapped by evil people, sometimes gangsters. I\u2019m pretty sure that my strategy for survival in such terrorizing dreams was frequently to kowtow to my oppressors, including acting as a metaphorical camp capo who could stay alive by harming others (though, I think, trying to find ways not actually to do such harm). I don\u2019t know when these dreams stopped, but I think it was only after considerable psychotherapy, which means in my late 30s at the earliest and probably later. (Until about 10 or 15 years ago, in the middle of a shower I would often feel a patina of gloom envelop me, which stopped after my therapist, the child of survivors, suggested I was being reminded of the Nazi gas chambers.)<\/li>\n<li>At one point, that therapy brought to the surface an image of my father, who was often physically abusive to me (more on that to be discussed elsewhere), in a Gestapo uniform. I don\u2019t think I consciously had that image as I grew up, but who knows?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>My parents were part of a small leftist Jewish community of chicken farmers, a number of whom were escapees from Hitler. I don\u2019t know if any of them attended any shul, but we didn\u2019t. I was six when Israel became a state, and I remember great celebration among my parents and their radical refugee friends: the ideal Jewish socialist state had arrived!<\/p>\n<p>Consciousness of the Holocaust, along with the fellow-traveler political perspectives my parents imbued in me, is what makes me intolerant of oppression of anybody, and it is a major reason tears come to my eyes during even the corniest story about someone of virtue helping out a suffering victim of any place or age. It is also the basis for my rage at the Jewish socialist homeland\u2019s betrayal of its birth and the way it treats its Other as an undifferentiated collection of enemies.<a href=\"#_ftnref6\">[3]<\/a><\/p>\n<p>That last statement is also an indicator of the way I realized a few decades ago that in the face of charges of being a Jewish anti-Semite because I don\u2019t support Israel, I do have a certain, very different prejudice that because of \u201cour\u201d history, capped by the Holocaust, we should behave better than others. I have to keep reminding myself that all ethnic groups are riddled with a wide range of admirable and non-admirable people.<a name=\"_ftnref6\"><\/a><a href=\"#_ftn6\">[4]<\/a><\/p>\n<p>While I am well aware of and troubled by the history of anti-semitism (or rather, anti-Jewish prejudice, since we\u2019re not the only semites; I have never figured out a way around the confusing usage), it has been mostly the Holocaust (in which I\u2019m unaware of losing any relatives, though as a child I occasionally saw forearms with blue tattooed ID numbers) that shaped whatever Jewish identity I have possessed. It would feel like betrayal of all that suffering to deny my technical\/cultural (certainly not religious) connection to Judaism. For some decades, I\u2019ve realized this is a negative connection. But without that sense, I\u2019m not sure I would have ever bothered to identify myself as a Jew or raise my son with consciousness of that background.<\/p>\n<p>Along with my sister, I and another boy who was a day older than I were the only Jews in the rural school system we attended through junior high school. My parents\u2019 left-wing Jewish refugees from Hitler apparently lived in other towns. Our district did not have its own high school, so starting in 10<sup>th<\/sup> grade all students were bused about 10 miles away (Vineland) to a high school that had lots of Jewish kids. I don\u2019t remember what I made of that, or the reason for the demographic, but it was the end of whatever isolation I\u2019d felt as a Jew in the middle of nowhere. I suspect I enjoyed no longer being a weird cultural specimen. I don\u2019t know how many of my (new) friends were Jewish, though I do remember a tall orthodox boy, Philip Berg, who was graduated 2<sup>nd<\/sup> in our class, went to Princeton (which still had a quota on Jews), and, as I heard it, lost physical and religious virginities there and flunked out fairly quickly. Philip was very bright, and I hope he found a better way through life.<\/p>\n<p>Around 13, I was briefly taught Hebrew by the wife of a close couple. I didn\u2019t take to it (my graduate studies in the European Renaissance would make me regret that, but it was too late, as I was far too along in adulthood to go back to learning piano that I also hated as a child). I was never bar-mitzvahed. I think I was given the option and didn\u2019t take it. (I did the same thing with my son, though I knew having the freedom to choose would make him likely to reject the ritual and all the work it would require.) Around the age of 16, for reasons I don\u2019t remember, I had a brief period of regretting the lack of a bar mitzvah. That feeling didn&#8217;t last for more than a few months. (My son, in his late teens, went through a period of embracing whatever version of orthodoxy, including dress, he figured out on his own.)<\/p>\n<p>We had seders, at which my father had some reputation for elaborately and histrionically playing out the story of Moses and the plagues. This became an amused reference in our family folklore. My main memories of the seders are: hunger from waiting seemingly forever to get to the actual food, minimal interest in the story (though I learned it and was pleased in recent years to discover that it has little or no basis in reality), dislike for Mogen David wine (I\u2019m not sure how young I was when first allowed to drink it), annoyance at having to learn the 4 questions (<em>vier kashas<\/em>?) related to \u201cwhy is this night different from all other nights,\u201d trepidation at having to face the pain of horseradish, a zest for being the kid to find the afikomen [spelled that right but had to check] (and I think I eventually tried unsuccessfully to watch for when my father would disappear to hide it), quickly alienated by the chocolate Hanukkah gelt (could that be the source of my dislike for milk chocolate?), and generally wanting to avoid seders, which I largely did in adulthood (though I took my son to at least a couple for whatever cultural awareness that would give him).<\/p>\n<p>In junior high I encountered extensive anti-Semitism, but probably because neither my sister nor the other Jewish boy had such a problem, I have always believed it was not \u201creal.\u201d I was a wimpy, inhibited, relatively unsocial kid who was also very smart (itself a sure-fire way to garner schoolmates\u2019 derision) and probably came across as over-proud of my intelligence. A kid named Slick (obviously a powerful influence in my life or I wouldn&#8217;t remember his name) especially picked on me and sometimes hit me. (I did eventually sort of stand up to him\u2014after my father\u2019s angry tirade and basic boxing lessons when I let him learn what was happening\u2014and while I doubt I hurt him in any way, my vague memory is that the hitting then stopped.) The favorite taunt I remember from Slick and his cohorts was to call me \u201crabbi.\u201d (I think in our last couple of years in high school he, as the phraseology went, knocked up a girl and married her.) But I don\u2019t think these kids even knew what the word meant\u2014or what it meant to be \u201cJewish.\u201d (No one ever called me a Christ-killer. I did have other friends from the same Catholic background with whom I routinely and contentedly played sports.) I think that they just didn\u2019t like who I was, and picked up that my Jewishness (any physical or behavioral differentness would have done just as well) was a basis for attack.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><a name=\"_ftn1\"><\/a><a href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]<\/a> My father wrote \u201cmemoirs\u201d (covering only memories of his childhood), which include references to his father\u2019s infidelity\u2019s and family desertions.

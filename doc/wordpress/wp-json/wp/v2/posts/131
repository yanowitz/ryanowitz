This is not exactly news: for some years, \u201cexposure\u201d of textbook bias has been discussed, but few seem to know about it (or know but dismiss its importance?).*<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the article\u2019s\nnumerous examples condemn omissions or changes of emphasis in the Texas\nversions, and often these are indeed disturbing (though not always in quite the\nway the article suggests). Not surprisingly, the two States\u2019 standards for\naddressing social justice issues (and that label covers far more ground than\nmany of us realize) often differ. While my own biases jibe far more with what I\nknow of the California approach, and I\u2019m to the left of the NYT, my academic\nself has problems with both textbooks and with the <em>Times <\/em>article itself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most saliently, both versions\nof the \u201csame\u201d textbook assume that \u201cfacts\u201d are unambiguous and value-free (if\nyou&#8217;re in doubt, think about racial and ethnic stereotypes on which most\nscientists agreed not so long ago, or how religion and science have frequently\nclashed)\u2014reciprocal concepts I abandoned after completing an undergraduate\nphilosophy degree but which I too often see ignored even by reputable scholars.\nWhat seems to me to be missing in the textbooks (at least the <em>Times <\/em>article\ndoesn\u2019t mention this) is an up-front discussion of the problems of producing\nhistory and the impossibility of \u201cobjectivity\u201d in its traditional use (as\nopposed to a version that ASPIRES to \u201cfull\u201d objectivity but knows it\u2019s\nimpossible).**<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>Times <\/em>writer is\nraising important issues, For example, in many cases \u201cclassroom materials are\nnot only shaded by politics, but are also helping to shape a generation of\nfuture voters.\u201d But immediately after this important observation, the writer\nqualifies it with successive paragraphs that contrast \u201cconservatives\u201d\n(exemplified by a Trump quote about the \u201c\u2018radical left\u2019\u201d) and \u201cthe left\u201d\n(without \u201cradical\u201d\u2014 but with Trump\u2019s quotation as the immediate antecedent,\nencouraging the notion that the terminology is equivalent). Both terms suggest\nequivalent political extremism (and who other than an obnoxious zealot likes\nextremism?) and gloss over the presence of a wide subset of attitudes within\neach \u201cextreme.\u201d Worse, by now having framed the rest of the article with these\n\u201cextremes,\u201d the <em>Times\u2019 <\/em>writer is allowing (really, encouraging) us to\nthink that \u201ctruth\u201d (whatever that is) lies in some desirable \u201cmoderate\u201d\nposition between these clearly dire perspectives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m not about to do a\nthorough scholarly investigation of the textbooks, but I\u2019ll take up three examples\nin the article (and I\u2019ll welcome substantiated corrections from those who have\nlooked into this subject more than I).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>\u201cOn [an] annotated Bill of Rights, California textbook\nexplains that rulings on the Second Amendment have allowed for some gun\nregulations\u201d while \u201cthe Texas edition\u2026contains only a blank white space.\u201d<\/em> The Texas total omission, of course, is easy to\nfault. But the <em>Times\u2019<\/em> own summary (\u201callowed for some gun regulations\u201d)\ndistorts the textbook\u2019s valiant effort to synthesize in a few words the thorny running\narguments about gun control: \u201callowed\u201d suggests a good thing, and \u201cregulations\u201d\nsounds \u201creasonable.\u201d From the perspective of some gun owners, however, and the\nNRA in particular, the textbook\u2019s words are themselves misleading. No matter\nhow you summarize the issue, you&#8217;ll alienate some readers: those who think\nstrong gun control measures are necessary and legal will say that giving weight\nto the opposition legitimizes an immoral position that is taking many lives,\nwhile gun \u201crights\u201d advocates will claim that a key moral issue is personal\nfreedom. It might seem that a careful re-statement of what I just wrote could\nbe \u201cobjective\u201d\u2014except it wouldn&#8217;t be, because it castrates the vital moral\nunderpinning of the disputants. This is where we need more good teachers to\nlead productive classroom discussions.<\/li><li><em>With regard to the Texas version for the Harlem\nRenaissance, the Times summarizes \u201csome critics \u2018dismissed the quality of\nliterature produced.\u2019\u201d<\/em> (1) Why NOT\nmention this, since at a raw level it\u2019s apparently accurate (and therefore its\nomission in the California version is misleading)? (2) On the other hand, why\nis the Texas version so vague and undocumented with specifics? What does this\n\u201cfact\u201d tell us about American culture, racial or otherwise, in the 1920s? Who\nwere these \u201ccritics\u201d? Were the criticisms racist-driven, or did they have some\nother basis\u2014and what are the credentials of who says what on the subject? What\n\u201cliterary\u201d standards were used, and do we still use them? How does such\ncriticism of the Harlem Renaissance compare with other literary (or any)\nmovements that were initially bad-mouthed by contemporary \u201ccritics\u201d? (3) Both versions\nthen include a valuable SPECIFIC criticism from Langston Hughes about SPECIFIC\npoliticallimitations of the Harlem Renaissance. What relation did\nHughes\u2019 comment have to those of the \u201ccritics\u201d mentioned in the Texas version?\n(4) How much do similar problems arise elsewhere in either State\u2019s version? Or\nmore to the point: How do you create a textbook at all that does critical\njustice to the vast topics it covers? How do you pick and choose what bits to\ninclude or exclude from the content?<\/li><li><em>\u201cThe Texas book\u2026states that American action on global\nwarming may not make a difference if China, India, Russia and Brazil do not\nalso act.\u201d<\/em> Is the Texas version\ntrying to take pressure off the US? Maybe. But as far as it goes, is the\nstatement wrong? Is the rhetorical \u201clogic\u201d that the US needn\u2019t take any\nmeasures in the meantime? (Will that fly with young people who are understandably\ngetting increasingly enraged about the world we elders have produced for them?)\nCan teachers not flesh out such implications and lead discussions about them?\n(Maybe the real, shameful disconnect here is that one quid-pro-quo implication\nis that global warming can be tolerated until all major polluting nations take\nequally significant counter-actions. I am, nonetheless, mildly grateful if\nTexas standards don\u2019t demand giving space to denier arguments\u2014though of course my\ngratitude expresses its own bias.)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>* As my wife puts such\nmatters, we may asymptotically approach the desired result but never reach it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We shouldn&#8217;t be surprised\nthat local biases infiltrate textbooks\u2014so far as I have been able to tell, they\nalways have. For example, to reinforce legitimacy of scripture, a child\u2019s English\nRenaissance writing textbook might use biblical quotes as examples.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>**Every time we do criticism,\nwe shouldn&#8217;t <em>have <\/em>to repeat this nostrum, but many arguments act as\nthough it isn\u2019t true and\/or relevant. For those not familiar with it, and in\nthe spirit of (relatively) full disclosure, here is my summary:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>All our judgments get filtered through our life\nexperiences (many relevant ones unveiled in psychotherapy) and fundamental\nbeliefs (or, as I like to call them, axioms, like some, maybe all, statements in\nthis list; religious people typically call them articles of faith that start\nwith belief in some form of divine being or beings concerned with human\nexistence).<\/li><li>We\u2019re often not aware of these basic assumptions, but argumentation\nis impossible if we have fundamentally different ones. <\/li><li>No matter how hard we try, we can\u2019t entirely escape\ninfluences of these biases (notice how I\u2019m equating a number of different\nterms).<\/li><li>Our intellectual task, then, is to figure out how to\nminimize those influences when we want to persuade others to a given point of\nview.<\/li><li>This is true of every academic (including the\nsciences) or non-academic thought process.<\/li><li>As much as possible, we can learn and try to use tools\nof critical thinking designed to achieve traditional objectivity.<\/li><li>We can learn how to be self-critical in what we think and\nlimit the power of our biases over us (though SOMETIMES those biases produce\ninsights we\u2019d otherwise miss), but like the \u201cremember, thou art mortal\u201d mantra\nwhispered into Caesar\u2019s ear, we must remember that we can never entirely free\nourselves of our biases, regardless of how aware of them we are.<\/li><li>When we argue with someone, we should acknowledge our\nown relevant biases and identify where they differ from or agree with the other\nperson\u2019s.<\/li><\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Times published an article (https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2020\/01\/12\/us\/texas-vs-california-history-textbooks.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share ) that compares textbook editions of the past four years from the same publisher (McGraw-Hill or Pearson) for 8th- and 11th-grade social studies in the influential markets of Texas and California.

How Did Capitalism Ever Get Along without Thee??<\/strong><\/em><em><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>It appears that advertising as a profession and a business arose in the late 19<sup>th<\/sup> century.<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\">[1]<\/a> With the advent of digital media, we are probably confronted with hundreds, maybe even thousands, of ads every day,<a href=\"#_edn2\" name=\"_ednref2\">[2]<\/a> though not nearly as many as the 10,000 frequently cited with little empirical evidence.<a href=\"#_edn3\" name=\"_ednref3\">[3]<\/a><\/p>\n<p>I often despair at how much our lives are manipulated by elites\u2014governmental, economic, religious, policing\u2014add your own troubling categories.. Not too long ago, I became especially aware of how social institutions like on-line media (news media, social media, retail media, and on and on) tell us what we should care about<a href=\"#_edn4\" name=\"_ednref4\">[4]<\/a>\u2014and how we way too often submit to their enticements.<a href=\"#_edn5\" name=\"_ednref5\">[5]<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Advertising of a material product, or a political candidate or cause, is the most obvious, and perhaps longest lived, example, but nowadays it\u2019s often a subset of some larger \u201cconcern\u201d to which we\u2019re being alerted. I think the problem extends to the entire digital world, especially in this age of nearly constant attention to our digital devices (which seems to cut across ALL age groups\u2014that\u2019s right, us old codgers, too).<\/p>\n<p>Some examples:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Picking up on contemporary standards for what is important in our world (commonly revolving around money, power, controversy, and sexual attractiveness), news headlines highlight people whom media and their subjects want us to care about, like billionaires (as in the catastrophe of the deep-sea vessel visiting the Titanic, or the latest shenanigans of Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, or Jeff Bezos), or feuding politicians (especially when they&#8217;re in the same party), or people characterized as celebrities (as in how much money they just paid or received for a house, or whom they&#8217;re sleeping with). More everyday casualties of any sort don\u2019t generate sufficient readership.<a href=\"#_edn6\" name=\"_ednref6\">[6]<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Headlines commonly use unspecified but titillating references about supposedly important information, so that digital lemmings that we are, we click and read what is often bland content. But by the time we realize that, we\u2019ve witnessed multiple ads embedded with the \u201cnews\u201d item\u2014and often, we anyway click on links embedded in the \u201cnews\u201d story.<\/li>\n<li>Headlines lure us with heart-stopping adjectives like \u201cbombshell,\u201d \u201cstunning,\u201d \u201cshocking,\u201d \u201cdevastating,\u201d \u201cjaw-dropping,\u201d<\/li>\n<li>We take brand names so for granted that when a crossword puzzle uses them for entries, we feel proud if we know the relevant name\u2014or frustrated with ourselves if we don\u2019t. <a href=\"#_edn7\" name=\"_ednref7\">[7]<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Do we ever question the media\u2019s construct of imaginary agglomerations of people with supposedly unified positions? These instant individual or group self-styled authorities give us the scoop on endless significant or trivial features of our culture. Here are some generic templates used by so many digital media sources:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sports report vital information like \u201cMajor League Baseball [or your own favorite professional or collegiate sport] world [or \u201cTwitter\u201d or just \u201cthe internet\u201d] expresses [some elaborate emotion, preferably akin to outrage] over [anything at all]\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Or: [Athlete in some sport] [accomplishes something unspecified] never before seen<a href=\"#_edn8\" name=\"_ednref8\">[8]<\/a> [or at least not seen in donkey\u2019s years]<\/li>\n<li>\u201c[Very young person] gets rich [with unspecified innovation] \u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cThe [some one- or two-digit number] best [Netflix films this month, EVs, hidden travel sites, etc., etc.]\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cI\u2019m an expert in [anything the news service has dreamed up], and I have this startling news for you\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cThe nation [gasps\/reels\/reacts] as [one famous person or social group or government institution attacks another]\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cNew poll shows [dramatic but unspecified truth about some topic of purportedly crucial importance]\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cGenius trick[s] to [accomplish something you&#8217;ve unwittingly been doing all wrong up to now]\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cShoppers agree on the superiority of [some popular consumer item], and it\u2019s on sale right now at [usually Amazon] for [this amazingly low price that you can\u2019t pass up]\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201c[You need to] [do this thing you didn\u2019t know about] right away\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cMost iconic [whatever]\u201d<\/li>\n<li>[Review after review (including great bargains, as appropriate) of anything imaginable, material or otherwise]<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I have the impression that sources about which we might care have taken up many of these techniques to draw us in<a href=\"#_edn9\" name=\"_ednref9\">[9]<\/a>\u2014and, not incidentally, to motivate us to make donations. Here are some examples from August 9 of this year (I will not waste your time or mine with examples from the <em>Wall Street Journal<a href=\"#_edn10\" name=\"_ednref10\"><strong>[10]<\/strong><\/a><\/em>):<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>NPR: \u201cA boy on the autism spectrum struggled with a haircut.

A lot of people seemed to feel patriotism was wrapped up with either rooting for the Americans or condemning them, and apparently the outspoken Rapinoe has become the focal point for whatever is viewed as wrong with the team.<\/em><a href=\"#_edn15\" name=\"_ednref15\">[15]<\/a><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Rapinoe has made some critical comments about the US (no free speech in sports, of course), and has been taken to be unpatriotic (I can only hope she is).<a href=\"#_edn16\" name=\"_ednref16\">[16]<\/a><\/li>\n<li>The concern in the headline, however, is not stated to be about soccer but about the entire United States.<\/li>\n<li>Given other sports headline phraseology, we might have expected this statement to start with something like \u201cUS soccer world.\u201d But no\u2014suddenly the entire globe (try to picture that) is gripped by this drama and has deep concerns about this very narrow topic, symbolized by a single soccer player, in one very specific country.<\/li>\n<li>Of course, we won\u2019t know what Rapinoe\u2019s \u201cclear opinion\u201d is unless we click on the headline. I leave it to curious readers to suss out exactly what the expression means.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><em>A final note<\/em>: You may have observed that I have not ventured into the quicksand of internet use for political malfeasance, though of course politics and any economic system intertwine to the point of being indistinguishable.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\">[1]<\/a> I have a vague memory that Henry James used the novelty of professional advertising as one key character\u2019s job.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref2\" name=\"_edn2\">[2]<\/a> I gather that for starters, an awful lot of people, and especially young people, subscribe to multiple social media, which I also gather are riddled with ads.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref3\" name=\"_edn3\">[3]<\/a> One thoughtful article on the history of such estimates begins with \u201cHundreds of articles and blogs will tell you that we see up to 10,000 ads a day. The problem? No one \u2013 from Harvard professors to Market Research Council hall-of-famers \u2013 believes it\u2019s true.\u201d (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedrum.com\/news\/2023\/05\/03\/how-many-ads-do-we-really-see-day-spoiler-it-s-not-10000\">https:\/\/www.thedrum.com\/news\/2023\/05\/03\/how-many-ads-do-we-really-see-day-spoiler-it-s-not-10000<\/a>)<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref4\" name=\"_edn4\">[4]<\/a> You might wish to add that they also try to tell us what and how to think, but I see that as a side issue (albeit troubling) that doesn\u2019t matter so long as you buy advertised goods and services.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref5\" name=\"_edn5\">[5]<\/a> My only social medium is Facebook, which I view infrequently and almost entirely for leftish political posts (though these can get pretty repetitive). If you&#8217;re on one of the social media, think about how often you click on ads.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref6\" name=\"_edn6\">[6]<\/a> Except, it seems, for the latest wartime deaths and mutilations, many or few, in Ukraine (but typically not Russia, much less other countries where fighting is happening).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref7\" name=\"_edn7\">[7]<\/a> <em>Further re brands<\/em>: Consider how we love to urge specific brands or businesses on our friends. And how we offer this free advertising without expecting to be paid by the companies we\u2019re touting.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref8\" name=\"_edn8\">[8]<\/a> I like to imagine that the unique event (they are almost daily) is scatological.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref9\" name=\"_edn9\">[9]<\/a> Even the leftish Huffpost[9] has a daily section called \u201cHuffpost personal\u201d that, judging by its headlines, are full of extravagantly boring personal tales imagined to be valuable for our own lives.<\/p>\n<p>How many readers today know that Ariana Huffington was once a right-winger married to a California Republican congressperson? Not, of course, that past behavior should ever be predictive of future results.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref10\" name=\"_edn10\">[10]<\/a> Of course, nothing and no one is objective in the sense we normally mean by that term, but the <em>Journal<\/em> can almost always be counted on to push any news in a conservative if not ultra-right direction. I have some limited trust in, but still check with caution, headlines (and sometimes parts of corresponding articles) in the <em>NY Times <\/em>and the <em>Washington Post<\/em> (though I never forget that Jeff Bezos owns the <em>Post<\/em>), but I use FAIR (<em>Fair and Accuracy in Reporting<\/em>\u2014fair.org) to keep up with current examples of how journals like these are skewing news, especially in relation to biases about social justice and economic issues. I have some fondness for, and relative trust in, articles in, <em>The Atlantic<\/em>,<em> The New Yorker <\/em>and <em>The Nation.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref11\" name=\"_edn11\">[11]<\/a> If it\u2019s so goddamned important, why isn\u2019t the answer in the headline????<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref12\" name=\"_edn12\">[12]<\/a> Judging by the second line, the answer to the question is \u201cyes.\u201d (I refuse to click and find out.) If so why pose it as a question? And notice that we are to assume, here and elsewhere, that ANY \u201cscientist\u201d is an unimpeachable source.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref13\" name=\"_edn13\">[13]<\/a> Is \u201chere\u201d so complicated it can\u2019t be specified in a word or short phrase?<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref14\" name=\"_edn14\">[14]<\/a> So hard not to click and see the details on this especially provocative locution\u2026but I managed\u2026so far.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref15\" name=\"_edn15\">[15]<\/a> Aside from losing that key match, during the tournament many of the American players refused to pay homage to the \u201cStar-Spangled Banner.\u201d Reading a headline about this supposedly unpatriotic protest of American social injustice, which I could wish all athletes would repeat, is what made me pay attention to the tournament at all.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"#_ednref16\" name=\"_edn16\">[16]<\/a> I have always felt dismay at how patriotism (coined in English in the 17<sup>th<\/sup> century) remains so highly valued, apparently in all countries. I always liked the relatively conservative Samuel Johnson\u2019s \u201cPatriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel\u201d until I recently learned that, according to Boswell, who recorded the quote, \u201che did not mean a real and generous love of our country, but that pretended patriotism which so many, in all ages and countries, have made a cloak for self-interest.\u201d (I took this quote from <a href=\"https:\/\/interestingliterature.com\/2021\/05\/patriotism-is-the-last-refuge-of-the-scoundrel-meaning-origins\/\">https:\/\/interestingliterature.com\/2021\/05\/patriotism-is-the-last-refuge-of-the-scoundrel-meaning-origins\/<\/a>. You can find the larger context by searching for a unique part of the quote in Gutenberg.org\u2019s version of Boswell\u2019s voluminous <em>Life of Johnson <\/em>at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/cache\/epub\/1564\/pg1564-images.html\">https:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/cache\/epub\/1564\/pg1564-images.html<\/a>.)

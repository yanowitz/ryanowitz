(Of course at important levels,\nit\u2019s never ended.) At that time, the line of us angels was to support federal\nintervention and condemn southern states\u2019 claims of \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d to have\ntheir own discriminatory laws and enforcement without federal \u201cinterference.\u201d\n(One of the many sad tendencies since then has been for conservatives in\nlegislative or judicial power to undermine legal achievements of that time,\nhowever insufficient, of those days.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over\nthe decades since then, this polarity has gradually reversed. Today, what\npeople like to call red states (which include many southern states), often with\ngovernors who support trump and his approach to whatever reality he perceives\nor chooses to encourage about anything, are generally in favor of federal\nmanagement of controversial social matters. At the moment, they often prescribe\nvarious levels of laxity in response to the COVID-19 crisis, while the rest of\nus (including the many residents of those \u201cred\u201d states who don\u2019t trust what\ntrump says and are helpless to avoid the consequences) are insisting on\n\u201cstates\u2019 rights.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This\nis human psychology, this is politics: fear change, grope around for the\nargument (even \u201cphilosophy\u201d) that will further your case, and have no reference\nto history other than to cite precedents that seem to support your viewpoint.\nIn short, critical thinking gets in the way of what we emotionally want to\nthink and so is not the first line of defense for many people (probably to a\ngreat extent because it\u2019s not well taught or valued in large parts of our\neducation system).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The\ntruth, of course, is that at any given moment those in power will seek to\nexercise their will and rationalize it in ways that too many people will\ngratefully embrace\u2014and all too often, opponents act similarly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\ndon\u2019t know what to do about this except call it out and side with the angels\n(in this case, the people and governing folk who are trusting the bulk of what\nmedical science is recommending). Can those angels make mistakes? Of course,\nbut would we rather take our chances on them than on people who are acting from\nand trusting the authenticity of their gut with no \u201cfacts\u201d?*<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As\nit\u2019s always done, this problem is going to keep coming up in dealing with\nsocial justice. It will do so even when we get rid of trumpite rulers. But\nright now, it is especially important as we face who knows how long a pandemic,\nlikely future pandemics, and the possibility that the current Washington regime\nwill take steps to stay in power indefinitely. (Imagine the wartime election\ncry of \u201cDon\u2019t change horses in midstream,\u201d for example. Or an executive coup\nd\u2019\u00e9tat.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it\npossible on a vast scale for us collectively to learn to bypass clich\u00e9 appeals\nand examine issues on their separate merits? Individually, of course that\u2019s\nalready happening on a significant scale, but is it likely to occur\ncollectively enough to make a difference? Jaded as I am by nearly eight decades\nof living, I doubt it. Nonetheless, I will keep paying attention to what I deem\nto be the minds most likely to be accurately assessing problems and proposing\nsolutions. And I will keep validating those who do the same while attempting to\nput forth information that doubters might pay attention to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\nrepeat a point I often make in public posts\u2014that this exact conundrum will\ncontinue to exist in tackling the even more deadly threat of the climate\ncrisis. My frail hope is that our current experience in hunkering down against\na dire threat (and, for those who survive, re-building a functional\neconomy\u2014though it is likely just to recapture or worsen what previously\nexisted) will change at least some thinking about what can and should be\nlistened to and done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>_______________<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>*I\nput \u201cfacts\u201d in quote because especially in controversial matters, such\nframeworks typically have their own problems of exactitude and general\nagreement. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Some of you will remember, and I hope others have learned about, the civil rights struggle of the late 50s and through the 60s.

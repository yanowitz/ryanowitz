language, and especially about disputes over its proper use.\u00a0 Shaped by Renaissance humanism and Reformation politics, the clash centered on a network of ideas about rhetoric and Christianity rooted in humanist curricula of the schools, and often universities, that most of the disputants had attended.<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn1\">[1]<\/a>\u00a0 If you spent much time in Tudor public schools (places where otherwise unrelated students learned in a group\u2014in \u201cpublic\u201d\u2014rather than \u201cprivate\u201d instruction at home) you came to adulthood as convinced that language is God\u2019s special grace to human well-being as modern Westerners believe in popularized notions of Freud and Einstein.\u00a0 Brought to England via continental humanism, platitudes about the power of language had permeated your schooling, and you could likely make witty (in your eyes, at least) allusions to the best-known of them at social gatherings or in the corridors of court.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Citing different, often divergent, myths, your classic and Christian sources informed you that under divine inspiration some great personage (always male) \u201cdiscovered\u201d language and bequeathed it to humankind to further our well-being\u2014and that thanks to the inevitability of worldly decay, your contemporary language was a shadow of its former greatness.\u00a0 Your primary classical supports were Cicero and Horace, who described a dismal, antique time when humanity lived entirely like beasts, governed only by emotion (today we might say id) unmediated by the divine spark of reason.\u00a0 Happily, however, a great master of language appeared and taught these barbarians<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn2\">[2]<\/a> how to speak, and so how to share reason.\u00a0 Shared speech in turn prompted the invention of the arts and made possible a shared community, a \u201ccivil\u201d society: the very meaning of civilization has its roots in linguistic skill.\u00a0 For Cicero (106-43 B.C.), oratory was the primal civilizing tool;<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn3\">[3]<\/a> for Horace (65-8 B.C.), it was poetry (which embodies imaginative literature in general), as exemplified by the musical prowess of Orpheus and Amphion. <a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn4\">[4]<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u00a0In early Christian writers you encountered a similar spirit argued on quite different grounds.\u00a0 Language was still a divine gift, but from a Christian God.<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn5\">[5]<\/a>\u00a0 It did not begin in some unspecified barbaric clime but in Eden when Adam named the animals under God\u2019s guidance.\u00a0 Instead of pagan orators and poets, great preachers and prophets of scriptural history, like Moses (a law-giver) and David (a musician\u2014and hence poet\u2014 who played the harp), \u201ccivilized\u201d humanity by bringing it divine truth.<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn6\">[6]<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever pieces of either tradition you embraced, you also believed that thanks to the Fall all worldly things decay.\u00a0 In historic times, the pure Latin of Cicero began deteriorating soon after his death, accelerated in its decline by medieval ignorance, while from the beginning of the world, the spiritual language Adam spoke in Eden was lost at the Fall along with human innocence.\u00a0 But because good language promotes social and religious virtue while wicked language undermines all civil order, you yearned for ways to regenerate the original power of speech.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This common heritage about the origin and fate of language diverged in two general directions.\u00a0 On one side were the pietists: basing themselves on patristic thought, convinced that human sin too readily abuses the truly spiritual power of language, adamant about the incompatibility of pagan and Christian thought, they condemned artful language\u2014orations, poetry, fictions, theater\u2014and promoted a Christian rhetoric to replace classical rhetoric.<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn7\">[7]<\/a>\u00a0 On the other side were the secularists, who ranged from the supposedly irreligious like Christopher Marlowe to deeply pious political figures like Thomas More and divines like George Herbert: no less concerned with the victory of true faith (whatever it might be) but believing that rhetoric, which includes any kind of artful language, figures forth divine truth, they felt no conflict in enhancing truth with artifice and integrating pagan thought into their Christianity.<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn8\">[8]<\/a>\u00a0 \u201cSecular\u201d here does not mean non-religious: like pietists, secularists were always religious in some way, which in England, as the sixteenth century proceeded, increasingly meant Protestant, with Catholics more and more marginalized and repressed.\u00a0 But pietists distanced themselves from both secularism and humanism, which they anyway considered synonymous and prone to be unChristian.<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn9\">[9]<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>What can you believe any more? and whom?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>What was incompatible between pietists and secularists wasn\u2019t entirely what they supposed.\u00a0 Whichever side drew your sympathy, as far as you knew you were arguing about who was moral and who wasn\u2019t, whose interpretation of true piety was correct and whose wasn\u2019t.\u00a0 In fact, however, you were often also <em>collaborating<\/em> to accelerate a drift away from long-standing attitudes about political, religious and intellectual roles.<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn10\">[10]<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For starters, there was the problem of political and religious authority.\u00a0 When the Reformation reached Tudor England,\u00a0plenty of people were still alive who could remember the crisis of authority raised by the Wars of the Roses that after decades of civil strife (historians differ on just when they \u201cbegan\u201d) ended with the defeat of Richard III at Bosworth Field in 1485. \u00a0The Reformation\u00a0brought with it dilemmas about obedience and conscience that the English approach aggravated in fusing Church and State.\u00a0 What would happen to your soul if you repudiated the anointed clergy who interceded with God on your behalf?\u00a0 What was your spiritual duty when you swore a holy oath to the Pope and then came to realize that Catholicism was the Antichrist?\u00a0 Where did your true loyalty and obedience lie when your religious conscience conflicted with the reigning monarch\u2019s?<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn11\">[11]<\/a>\u00a0 Living through these times, you witnessed periodic armed rebellions, intrigues that seemed as inevitable in the political soil as weeds in a garden, a clouded succession after Henry VIII divorced Catherine of Aragon (assuming you accepted Tudor victory at Bosworth Field in the first place), a traumatizing national shift from Protestantism to Catholicism and back to Protestantism within five years at the middle of the sixteenth century, and constant backbiting over orthodoxy among Protestants themselves.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As an educated person, whatever else prompted you to question authority\u2014 even before the Reformation you couldn&#8217;t long remain blind, for example, to widespread corruption in the papacy and among many Catholic clerics\u2014humanist textual and interpretive criticism had been key influences.\u00a0 When you re-examined the texts of your beloved pre-Christian Latin and Greek authorities to make sure you had their true meaning, you ended up <em>reducing<\/em> their dominance and authority as you saw modern minds shining in their own right\u2014cleansing old texts of corruptions accreted over the centuries, interpreting the hidden meanings of those texts, bringing to light lost texts that amplified ancient thought, and even exposing spurious texts like the Donation of Constantine.<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn12\">[12]<\/a>\u00a0 When you shifted your attention to religious matters\u2014the need for reform, whether from within Catholicism or by breaking from it\u2014your humanist bias towards returning to original sources in original languages gave you tools and a frame of mind for reading sacred texts in ways that helped you justify your cause.\u00a0 Your ability as a Reformer to renounce papal authority while affirming the ascendancy of the individual conscience to interpret scripture without clerical mediation was implicit in the psychology that allowed a humanist scholar, on his (or very occasionally her) own authority, to establish texts and what they meant.<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn13\">[13]<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Alongside often overt challenge to political and religious authority was an unconscious challenge to the intellectual authority of the centuries-old belief in a universe of correspondences, or resemblances, where you saw everything as a mirror or metaphor of everything else: you knew that God placed the earth at the center of the universe because the drama of human salvation is the center of heavenly concern; that comets presage earthly catastrophe; that mandrake roots look human because they have an occult affinity with human beings; that crawling serpents call attention to the lowliness of sin, and flying birds figure forth the aspirations of the soul; that the earth has changing seasons and lions devour lambs because the Fall destroyed terrestrial equanimity; that puns reveal a deep affinity among a word\u2019s disparate meanings; that wicked people are physically ugly to reflect their moral natures\u2026or that wicked people are physically appealing because material appearance is deceptive and sin must be attractive or else no would sin; that a tyrant is a visitation from God upon a wicked society&#8230;or a test of worthy souls; and so on, and on.\u00a0 This habit of mind made you, however selectively, interconnect all areas of human thought\u2014religion, morality, government, law, diplomacy, history, literature and gender roles (though of course this last construct wasn\u2019t part of your consciousness), to name a few.<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn14\">[14]<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As a secularist, you delighted in a universe filled with ambiguity and multiple truths that challenged your wit to endless searches for new connections that would unify seemingly disparate phenomena, a pursuit that reached its English literary climax with metaphysical conceits in secular and sacred poetry.\u00a0 At the same time, as you went about your critical business you were unintentionally undermining this world view by developing analytical tools and perspectives that assumed you could undo inherited corruptions in language, received texts, religion, natural philosophy (what came to be called \u201cscience\u201d in the 19<sup>th<\/sup> century).\u00a0 You were furthering a sense of unitary order, a sense that there <em>are<\/em> pure, lost or hidden truths free of ambiguity.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This way of viewing reality, however, contained an unrealized contradiction that humanism and Protestantism inherited from the medieval thought they both largely held in contempt.\u00a0 On the one hand, the universe of correspondences made you view \u201ctruth\u201d as multiple and ambiguous, expressible only indirectly (as through metaphor) and in endless ways. \u00a0On the other hand, however complex the order of the universe might be, you could imagine all correspondences neatly nesting together, as Pico della Mirandola embraced in aspiring to integrate the thought of all major cultures,<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn15\">[15]<\/a> and as the new natural philosophy was about to attempt by seeking universal laws that would eventually produce the image of a clockmaker God.\u00a0 Scholasticism, seeking supreme syntheses while also taking the universe of correspondences for granted, yoked the two tendencies together; the Renaissance, and especially the Reformation within (or overlapping) it, gradually pulled them asunder.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If Reform was your primary concern, you never consciously renounced the universe of correspondences\u2014that framework was so taken for granted that no one could dismiss its influence altogether; and noticing contradictions in the bedrock of one\u2019s thought in the midst of shifting world views has never been an easy business.\u00a0 But you could not afford to live with the resulting ambiguity.\u00a0 Caught up in life-and-death disputes with Catholicism (and before long with competing Protestant theologies), you felt driven to seek an argumentative conclusiveness forbidden to a universe of multiple truths.\u00a0 You invoked correspondences when you could make them fit your case and demanded unitary truth elsewhere.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The universe of correspondences did not suddenly vanish<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn16\">[16]<\/a>; indeed, it coexisted with the 16<sup>th<\/sup> and 17<sup>th<\/sup> centuries\u2019 evolving quest for single truth.\u00a0 Instead of reflecting on the essential nature of reality, what you saw yourself arguing about were questions like whether secularists were promoting falsehood when they wrote fictions or argued both sides of a moral question, or whether pietists were tyrants intent on polarizing society or foisting solipsistic visions of religiosity on everyone.\u00a0 Looking back from the twenty-first century, we can identify a pattern which contemporaries could not recognize, that the elegant and comforting explanations which had accompanied a universe of multi-layered meaning in which novelty was anathema were becoming decreasingly tenable as they encountered more and more contradictions in the changing times: a New World, new peoples, new mores, new animals, new plants; new (exploding) stars that appeared in the supposedly immutable heavens; new ways to make money that were bringing wealth to some people while overthrowing traditional methods of husbandry, land use and labor; a new natural philosophy that used mathematics and personal observation to explain nature and affirm a new kind of harmony and order to the universe, based on dispassionate, immutable laws\u2014while simultaneously threatening the reassuring presence of active, involved divinity in daily life.<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn17\">[17]<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Of all novelties, new religion was the most disturbing: Protestantism was challenging Catholic authority and corruptions.\u00a0 Catholicism felt itself battling to retain stability, continuity and familiarity in Christian belief. \u00a0In the name of Christianity, as a few contemporaries like Montaigne realized,<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn18\">[18]<\/a> Christians were slaughtering Christians all across Europe.\u00a0 An old order was disappearing, a new one rising, but neither was entrenched.\u00a0 Regardless of your intellectual stripe, even as you jerry-rigged newfangled responses to the instability of the times, you insisted that <em>you<\/em> were protecting tradition while your enemies were encouraging\u2026novelty.<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn19\">[19]<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>New logic<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>One sign of growing interest in single, definitive truth was a comeback for logic\u2014or what passed for it.\u00a0 While you had never thrown it out of the curriculum altogether, <a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn20\">[20]<\/a> as a humanist you had subjugated logic to rhetoric when setting your sights on the will rather than the intellect in your quest to fire audiences to virtuous action.\u00a0 That the <em>spirit<\/em> of truth was more important than its rigorous verifiability was a profoundly felt belief not only of educated people but also of religious people who may have had difficulty arguing theological nuances.\u00a0 Writing about the world, you went through the motions of consistent, step-by-step argumentation without making it your ultimate concern.\u00a0 You felt a commitment to promulgating beliefs, arguments and moral prescriptions regardless of \u201clogical\u201d c\u2014onsistency.\u00a0 Besides, you could never forget that logic was the core of scholasticism, a sterile Aristotelian heritage full of abstract, otherworldly concerns which minimized the value you placed in temporal affairs.\u00a0 If you were also a Reformer, whether pietist or secularist, you had other, theological reasons for scorning scholasticism and so, by association, the classical logic that otherwise had the enviable virtue of forcing the mind to single conclusions: the schoolmen had contributed to \u201cmodern\u201d Catholic corruptions\u2014practices going back, depending on the polemicist you were reading, to anywhere from the death of Christ to the reign of Charlemagne.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>What you needed was a new logic that would capture a spirit of systematic thinking while spurning Aristotle and the scholastics, and this you could find in Peter Ramus, a French Protestant who had taught eloquence and was killed in the St. Bartholomew\u2019s massacre of 1572.<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn21\">[21]<\/a>\u00a0 Ramistic logic filled two key needs.\u00a0 On the one hand it gave you a \u201clogic\u201d without syllogisms, replacing them with endless dichotomies.\u00a0 On the other hand, it included a theory of rhetoric based on Cicero.<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn22\">[22]<\/a>\u00a0 Ramism spread largely in Protestant countries and came to England in the last twenty years of the sixteenth century, where it was embraced not only by pietists but also by thinkers like Philip Sidney who, secular in temperament and puritan in religion, needed a way to revel in the rhetorical world of endless meaning while simultaneously keeping a sense of rigor about their religion.<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn23\">[23]<\/a>\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>New ways of thinking about nature<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The new natural philosophy echoed a humanist habit of looking for secret meaning.\u00a0 Growing in part from humanist empiricism (personal experience of reality, as in looking at ancient texts for yourself)<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn24\">[24]<\/a> and love of classical philosophy (for example, belief in universal laws, the geometrization of space, and application of mathematics to nature, which all owed debts to the revival of Platonism<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn25\">[25]<\/a>), the new philosophy sought to \u201cread\u201d nature as humanists read texts, scurrying to outwit her and penetrate to her carefully-hidden secrets.<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn26\">[26]<\/a>\u00a0 At the same time, the new philosophy, seeking orderly, singular, inexorable laws and explanations for natural phenomena, gradually repudiated the multi-layered universe of correspondences.\u00a0 One form of that repudiation was the program first proposed by Bacon, most famously urged by Thomas Sprat, and ridiculed by Jonathan Swift in Book III of <em>Gulliver\u2019s Travels<\/em>: to reform language (and implicitly, rhetoric and all of humanist wit) so that one word would come to stand for only one thing.<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn27\">[27]<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>All the world\u2019s a text<\/em><\/strong><strong>: <em>reading the universe<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A key link between old and emerging approaches to the world was the continuing importance of interpretation or perspective\u2014the awareness that the way you \u201clooked\u201d at something, with physical or mental eyes, determined your understanding of it\u2014and through it the capture or re-capture of hidden truth.\u00a0 Painters had learned to re-examine the world by playing with perspective to reproduce both physical and spiritual realities (a distinction blurred by attitudes towards allegory, as discussed below).\u00a0 In Tudor England, because your schooling was founded on rhetoric, because your educated consciousness assumed that texts shape experience the way the modern Westerner assumes matter is made up of atoms, you re-examined the world by seeing texts everywhere and reading them\u2014or more importantly, <em>re<\/em>-reading them: the word of God, the writings of the Church Fathers, the wisdom of classical thought, the myths of pagan Greece and Rome, the \u201csignatures\u201d embedded in worldly things,<a

mathematics.\u00a0 The very salvation of your soul depended on which scriptural text you chose to read and how you interpreted its key words and phrases\u2014for Catholicism, Jerome\u2019s Vulgate; for Protestantism the original scriptural languages (insofar as you could reconstruct them) and their (contentious) vernacular translations.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You penetrated the secrets of the text by unlocking the rhetorical strategies of ancient writers, exposing interrelated truths expressed through etymological plays on words, recognizing a grand design behind kindred meanings in puns and variant spellings, appreciating multiple meaning in ambiguous syntax.\u00a0 You read\u2014you interpreted, you established your text\u2014and like a painter adding visual perspective to fashion a new canvas,<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn30\">[30]<\/a> you fashioned new texts.\u00a0 You might emend an existing text to purge its (supposed) corruptions and restore its original purity, or you might pass along your discoveries by writing your own text, whether sermon, oration, commentary, polemic, homily, poem, play or narrative fiction.\u00a0 Always, you were \u201cimitating\u201d form and content of the past: you shaped your writing with rhetorical techniques, whether from a classical or Christian rhetoric (to the extent they could be totally distinguished), and you re-shaped\u2014we might say edited\u2014old accounts to make them applicable to modern times, whether you were a preacher drawing contemporary lessons from scripture or a dramatist re-shaping borrowed plots or\u00a0 history.\u00a0 Always, you were revealing the inner workings, the inner secrets, of your world.\u00a0 And always, you were revealing the depth and integrity of your own virtue, your own wit.\u00a0 (Usually, you were also writing for select, wise readers who could penetrate and appreciate your clever meanings.)\u00a0 What started as a desire to redeem pagan greatness to Christian service became the discovery of a new way to communicate among contemporaries.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This habit of mind began in school, where correct reading was the core of the Tudor humanist rhetorical curriculum and where you came to expect hidden meaning and surprises in what you read\u2014and gradually learned to achieve similar effects in your own writing.\u00a0 Although we first think of rhetoric<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn31\">[31]<\/a> as an approach to writing, for Tudor humanism it was at least as much a way of reading, which then provided a way of writing.\u00a0 Humanism, after all, doted on re-discovering texts; the literal fact of the discovery of ancient manuscripts, as with the fifteenth-century retrieval of texts long buried in a Greek monastery, was an emblem of the larger spirit of re-discovering classical texts and scripture by re-reading them to extract their lost or hidden meanings.\u00a0 Your quest was a holy one, to regenerate meaning placed in texts by their authors, and so to regenerate language\u2014and because texts shape the world, to regenerate the world itself.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In training you as a reader, Tudor rhetoric conditioned you to expect texts to surprise you, to expect them to play with mental perspectives as painters played with visual ones and to convey truth only when apprehended <em>all<\/em> the levels of meaning simultaneously\u2014only, finally, when you gave yourself up to the text and its tricks, became one with the text.<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn32\">[32]<\/a>\u00a0 Tudor rhetorical theory encouraged exactly these sorts of reading, for it placed self-consciousness at the center of the literary experience, whether as a conditioned reflex or deliberate strategy.<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn33\">[33]<\/a>\u00a0 As a result, the <em>essence<\/em> of rhetoric was to make language work in ways you did not expect\u2014to \u201cturn\u201d (a translation of \u201ctrope\u201d\u2014and \u201cverse\u201d<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn34\">[34]<\/a>) meaning from its accustomed content and thereby force you constantly to monitor your responses, so that the message was in the very movement of the rhetoric at least as much as in the diction. <a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn35\">[35]<\/a>\u00a0 With this attitude as a foundation, you and other Tudor writers stressed reading at least as much as writing or oral exercises, setting out to teach readers how to penetrate to hidden meanings through re-examining their own responses. \u00a0Union of reader and text could appear in ruminations on a plain style as well as secularist approaches to rhetoric:\u00a0for Thomas Cranmer, John King writes, the text of scripture \u201cin effect creates its own audience of readers who

Tudor writers would have had to invent it. \u00a0This kind of attitude demanded that you <em>expect<\/em> tricks in the rhetoric, <em>expect<\/em> to have ordinary experience of language and meaning violated, <em>expect<\/em> to keep reassessing the text and contrasting first and subsequent responses.\u00a0 The essence of rhetorical devices demanded that you have simultaneous consciousness of technique and meaning, whether as a writer or reader.<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn37\">[37]<\/a>\u00a0 This fusion of rhetoric and meaning, of the <em>experience<\/em> of reading with the <em>meaning<\/em> of the text, is one more example of how the theory of correspondences prodded your mind to view everything in the universe as a figure or metaphor or shadow of everything else.\u00a0 Form and content were not merely <em>like<\/em> correspondences in the universe; they were an <em>example<\/em> of correspondence.\u00a0 Levels of reality were superimposed upon one another.\u00a0 Principles on one plane of reality might be higher than those on another, but no more or less true, no more or less <em>readable<\/em>.\u00a0 You did not create new ideas but brought to consciousness ones already there.<a

up schools stressed the importance of\u00a0choosing \u201cgood\u201d texts.\u00a0 This was central, say, to pedagogical guidelines of the Spaniard Juan Luis Vives, a Tudor favorite: \u201cHe who would thus settle the choice of books [within a school], supported by a great knowledge and discriminating judgment would, in my opinion, truly confer a great benefit upon the whole race of mankind.\u201d<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn39\">[39]<\/a>\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Reading demanded re-reading.\u00a0 Tudor texts sought to startle by setting readers up to expect one thing and then giving them another.\u00a0 Rhetorical figures were \u201cturns,\u201d \u201calterations,\u201d \u201ctranslations,\u201d even \u201ctransmutations.\u201d\u00a0 They were intended to \u201cestrange\u201d and \u201cdeceive,\u201d \u201cabuse\u201d (with a root meaning of being applied away from or out of normal usage).<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn40\">[40]<\/a>\u00a0 Tudor writers were helped in promoting such definitions because their rhetorical vocabulary conveniently inherited a history of imprecision.\u00a0 Even the ancient originators of rhetorical theory, E. R. Curtius tells us, waffled about their basic terminology.\u00a0 While Greek <em>schemata<\/em>\u2014the same as Latin <em>figurae<\/em>\u2014in classical times were \u201cconventionally divided into figures of language and figures of thought\u201d (the first referring to patterns that words make and the second to ideas the words suggest), these seemingly clear distinctions quickly lose precision:<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Besides figures of language and thought, grammatical figures (that is, figures occurring in the exegesis of the poets) and rhetorical figures have been distinguished.\u00a0 Furthermore, antique and later textbooks commonly call many figures of speech <em>tropoi<\/em> (\u201cturns\u201d), <em>tropi<\/em>.\u00a0 This lack of a settled terminology, and, in short, the endless variations in enumerating and defining the figures, are to be explained historically by contacts between various schools.<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn41\">[41]<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For Tudor writers, \u201cturns\u201d applied to three general\u00a0categories common to rhetoric and poetry.\u00a0 Because they were making up the English terminology as they went along, writers varied on exactly how they grouped the categories and sometimes disagreed on the label for each.\u00a0 Writing in 1553, Thomas Wilson offered a typical breakdown:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">There are three kinds of figures, the one is when the nature of words is changed from one signification to another called a Trope of the Grecians: The other serveth for words when they are not changed by nature, but only altered by speaking, called of the Grecians a Scheme: The third is when by diversity of invention, a sentence is many ways spoken, and also matters are amplified by heaping examples, by dilating arguments, by comparing of things together, by similitudes, by contraries, and by diverse other like, called by Tully Exornation of sentences, or colors of rhetoric.<a

enigma.\u00a0 Schemes included syntactical rearrangements, which could lead to multiple meaning through ambiguity, and puns resulting from the fluidity of Tudor spelling.<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn43\">[43]<\/a>\u00a0 Orthographical schemes created deliberate changes in spelling\u2014adding letters or syllables to or subtracting them from words.\u00a0 Finally, colors or exornations included description, apostrophe, personification, temporary interruption in a narrative, digression, and other methods of narration.<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn44\">[44]<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>The rhetorical-allegorical universe<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A multi-layered universe with no distinction between primary and secondary meaning was supremely, simultaneously, rhetorical and allegorical,<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn45\">[45]<\/a> as Michael Murrin indicates when he explains that Renaissance allegorists expected (elite) readers to re-assess every detail of the surface meaning in the text to penetrate to hidden meaning: \u201ca poet is exploiting in his allegorical myths the interrelationship of the three worlds which make up the universe: the supercelestial, the celestial, and the sublunary&#8230;\u00a0 [He] talks about many things at the same time, using an image in one world to signify its corollaries in the other two.\u201d<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn46\">[46]<\/a>\u00a0 As we have seen, \u201creading\u201d relied on the same assumption, that more should be behind the words than meets the eye, and that one way or another, the text should end up surprising you.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When put <em>this<\/em> way the labels you placed upon Renaissance thought processes\u2014rhetoric, allegory, wit, poetry, drama, history, exegesis\u2014ended up as inseparable mirrors of one another, as synonyms for one another.\u00a0 Each area of thought might focus on a different cultural tradition, but they all applied the same quintessentially literary <em>habit of mind<\/em> to illuminate their subject matter and when combined with devotion to rhetoric as understood by Renaissance theorists, made the universe a kind of linguistic allegory.\u00a0 Just as in rhetoric there was no way to say whether the movement of the language or its content was \u201ctruer,\u201d so in allegory you could not say which level was \u201csurface,\u201d which superimposed.\u00a0 The principle here is the same as those children\u2019s picture puzzles that \u201chide\u201d animals in the landscape: until found, the animals are maddening in their elusiveness, but once recognized, they keep jumping out at you.\u00a0 Is the \u201cpurpose\u201d to hide the animals from the traditional eye, to reveal them to the astute eye that can rearrange experience, or to coerce the eye through delightful challenge to <em>learn how<\/em> to rearrange that experience?\u00a0 (Is any game only a game?)\u00a0 Is the \u201creal\u201d picture the one that hides the animals, or the cleverly concealed animals themselves?\u00a0 When you have finished, you stand back and look at both, admire both in their interrelationship\u2014and admire yourself for having \u201cread\u201d the picture in its totality.<a

href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn48\">[48]<\/a> with their insistence on hidden meanings in ancient Christian texts exactly mirrored the way you saw rhetoric working.\u00a0 Here was William Golding in 1567 explaining Ovidian fables:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0

again the darkened truth to light,<br \/>That all men may behold thereof the clearness shining bright?<br \/>The readers therefore earnestly admonished are to be<br \/>To seek a further meaning than the letter gives to see.<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn49\">[49]<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In scripture and pagan literature alike, you assumed that the study of Truth involved a quest for hidden meanings, a need to look at the surface narrative and <em>read<\/em> the superimposed truth apprehensible only to the mind specially trained or guided to virtue as a result of practice in analyzing texts.\u00a0 Learning the formulae of the rhetoric handbooks made you constantly aware of yourself as an audience evaluating texts, as an understander of texts, and encouraged a habit of mind that reinforced traditional rhetorical admonitions to consider one\u2019s audience: when you yourself wrote, you had keen consciousness of whom you wanted to address.\u00a0 In experiencing a culture so aware of audience response, of rhetorical organization, of mystery figured forth in words, of \u201cturning\u201d words to unexpected meanings, it should not be surprising that when experiencing the great works of literature of the time, we today still find ourselves drawn into a text and thrown off guard, re-evaluating our responses as we proceed through the text, struggling to absorb meaning from the very flow of the rhetoric.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Self-doubting enemies and their affinities<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Tudor intellectual culture was in the early throes of a shift away from stressing multi-valent truth (which we associate with Renaissance humanism) and towards unambiguous, unitary truth.\u00a0 In their dispute over the proper role of language that I examine in other chapters, secularists and pietists may have used different sources for their arguments but they were responding to a shared sense of breakdown in their familiar universe of orderly multiple meaning.\u00a0 As humanist pedagogy came to pervade Tudor schools and universities in the first half of the 16<sup>th<\/sup> century, secularists and pietists typically shared the same intellectual upbringing, which included the overarching commonality we have seen in treating all phenomena as texts to be interpreted.\u00a0 Such broad shared contexts point to an underlying empathy intermingled with temperamental antagonisms, suggesting that ultimately each \u201cside\u201d was unconsciously uneasy that its opponents might actually be right.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This was especially true because, of course, religious integrity trumped all other matters.\u00a0 If you were a Protestant pietist schooled to read and write in the context of\u00a0 humanist rhetorical principles, you nonetheless came to spurn classical rhetoric.\u00a0 You came to denounce its artifice and subterfuge, and you sought a Christian rhetoric with a \u201csimple\u201d or \u201cplain\u201d style that reproduced the supposedly \u201cplain\u201d techniques of scripture, that is, devoid of the involved, multiple meanings your schooling had taught you to expect.\u00a0 Whereas secularist rhetorical wit saw a world of complex texts filled with hidden meanings, you aimed for\u00a0unpretentious, straightforward truth in texts\u2014especially in scripture, so long victimized by Catholic sophistry that corrupted it with the multi-layered meaning of allegorical wit (as opposed to presumably \u201csimple\u201d scriptural allegory) penetrable only by a specially-trained priestly elite.\u00a0 Indeed, one unconscious reason you needed to renounce your humanist roots may well have been that humanist ways of reading <em>felt<\/em> Catholic, a sense reinforced by humanism\u2019s origins in Italy, a country which Protestant England made synonymous with vice and corruption.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, secularists, raised in the religions culture of their times, attending schools no less preoccupied with religion than with rhetoric, could not be entirely comfortable about their criticisms of pietism.\u00a0 For whatever else it does, schooling seeks to impose\u2014or assumes\u2014common cultural attitudes and expectations.<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn50\">[50]<\/a>\u00a0 So it was that as an adult, whether pietiest or secularist, however much you genuinely disagreed with your worst ideological enemies,<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn51\">[51]<\/a> you shared cultural assumptions with them that blurred the distinctions you both tried to draw.<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn52\">[52]<\/a>\u00a0 All of that seems pretty self-evident in cultural history, if not always out in the open.\u00a0 Less obvious but psychologically just as true is that when you opted for one received value or set of values over another, or when you disagreed about the exact meaning of a common value, you inevitably had <em>some<\/em> empathy for the position you were opposing.<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn53\">[53]<\/a>\u00a0 This was especially true if you were confronting an articulate opponent.\u00a0 I\u2019m not saying that you disbelieved what you were saying, or that your belief was insincere, or that your opinion was wrong (though is any opinion ever \u201cright\u201d?), but that because your childhood training conditioned you to favor principles embedded in your opponent\u2019s case, some (usually unacknowledged) part of yourself felt drawn to that view, felt some disquieting doubt about the legitimacy of your own position.\u00a0 The more compelling the issue, the more contempt you and your opponent were likely to display for each other\u2014precisely because you sensed but tried to deny a part of your own psyche in each other.<a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_edn54\">[54]<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"

Trevelyan: puritanism was \u201c\u2018the religion of all those who wished either to \u2018purify\u2019 the usage of the established church from taint of poetry or to worship separately by forms so \u2018purified.\u2019\u201d\u00a0 [<em>Tudor Puritanism<\/em> (Chicago, 1965; original edition 1939), 489]\u00a0 Even that definition is not sufficiently generalized for my purposes, since high Churchmen with sympathies for much in Catholicism could be thoroughly \u201cpuritan\u201d about moral rigor in general and the perniciousness of artful language in particular.\u00a0 Lawrence Sasek, though echoing Knappen\u2019s generalization (\u201cThe term [puritanism] is most useful if we apply it to the great force opposing the established church\u201d [<em>The Literary Temper of the English Puritans<\/em> (Baton Rouge, 1961), 17]), comes closer to my notion in noting that \u201cA \u2018puritan\u2019 opponent of the stage may be an orthodox Anglican who fought the puritans and, conversely, an active puritan opponent of the established church can, in literary history, turn out to be quite unpuritanical.\u201d\u00a0 [<em>Ibid<\/em>., 15]<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A stern moral rectitude that we associate with puritanism was not unique to England or continental Protestantism but part of a larger consciousness in Western Europe.\u00a0 Here, for example, is a statement in a 1565 Italian dialogue on country living that could as readily have appeared in an English Protestant polemic against urban vice:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">I know many women who are so involved with life in the city that they&#8230;want to dress up in the latest fashions, make themselves beautiful and wear perfume.\u00a0 They go around, bursting with vanity, wishing to be admired and flattered by everyone that sees them, thinking of nothing but dashing here and there wherever their fancy takes them.\u00a0 They turn up wherever there is a dance, a company, a tragedy, a joust, a feast or a tournament.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Another speaker develops this theme:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">People here [in the country as opposed to the city] are not ambitious, envious, proud or underhand; they are not disloyal, hot-tempered, vindictive or murderous; they are not cuckolded by their wives; still less will you find them acting as false witnesses, dishonest notaries, lying officials, false lawyers, unjust judges or devious clerks.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">This speaker catalogues city ills (and zealously describes the harsh punishment appropriate to each), starting with streetsweepers, garbage collectors, porters and wine-carriers, whose immorality is in their general demeanor, and then moving to bawds, whores, crooks, sorcerers, soothsayers, diviners, cheats, cutpurses, mercenaries, swaggering soldiers, hypocrites, confidence men, debtors, swindlers, murderers and traitors.\u00a0 Along the way, he mentions abusers of language and their punishments: \u201cslanderers having their eyes put out, blasphemers having their tongues slit,&#8230;false witnesses having their hands cut off.\u201d\u00a0 [from Agostino Gallo, <em>Le dieci giornate della vera agricoltura e piaceri della villa&#8230;<\/em> (Venice, 1565); I obtained these passages at a Harvard Center for Literary Studies gathering in March, 1990, conducted by James S.

the theme of sexual repression, at least, was a common anti-puritan charge of the day and appeared at least as late as Jonathan Swift\u2019s satire in <em>A Tale of a Tub<\/em>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Professor Ackerman\u2019s presentation focused on misogyny in a genre of advice to middle-class city folk about the merits of villas and how to run them.\u00a0 At the good villa:<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">[Y]ou do not hear people being slandered, as you often do under the loggia in the city, or in workshops or other places.\u00a0 I am not speaking now of vicious people but of ordinary respectable men and women who have no hesitation in blackening the reputation of honest wives, chaste widows, well-brought-up girls and even nuns!\u00a0 And they seem to enjoy talking about sordid things\u2026<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cPuritan\u201d tendencies everywhere were closely allied with running debates over pastoral vs. urban, country vs. court, contemplative vs. active, ignorance vs. learning, simplicity vs. civilization, nature vs. art, nature vs. nurture, and so on; in many ways, of course, they were all the same debate.\u00a0 True to their schoolboy training that required arguing both sides of a case, secularists tended to set forth\u00a0arguments for both positions in these dichotomies (see, e.g., <em>Loves Labours lost<\/em> or the Pastorella episode in Book VI of <em>The Faerie Queene<\/em>); pietists tended to press the first argument in each pair (as in stressing Christ\u2019s role as a shepherd and insisting on the \u201cplain\u201d meaning of scripture).<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_ednref8\">[8]<\/a> An epitome of secular writing was Erasmus\u2019 <em>Praise of Folly<\/em>, an elusive, quintessentially rhetorical text steeped in classicism and full of concern for piety by a man who had been a monk.\u00a0 Written in Latin in 1509 in Thomas More\u2019s house, it was popular throughout Europe.\u00a0 Erasmus made several trips to England, starting in 1499, and as far as early Tudor humanists were concerned, was practically an honorary Englishman.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_ednref9\">[9]<\/a> In modern America, of course, we see this tradition continuing in Christian fundamentalists who contemn something they call \u201csecular humanism.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_ednref10\">[10]<\/a> Hiram Haydn, <em>The Counter-Renaissance<\/em> (New York, 1960), addresses the Renaissance challenge to the Renaissance.\u00a0 The basis of ruling authority became muddy, the heavens appeared to be an extension of the earth rather than an unchanging realm all their own, modern observers seemed capable of discovering things unknown to the ancients.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Here\u2019s a modern example of such a change over a very short period of time: During the 1950s and most of the 1960s in America, there was general agreement among mainstream political parties and the dissenting left that resources for national growth were essentially unlimited; any disagreement was over how to allocate those resources, and who deserved them.\u00a0 In the late 1960s, a few people on the left\u2014a minority within a minority\u2014began to organize around the idea that resources are <em>not<\/em> unlimited.\u00a0 (When I first encountered such people in 1968 at a California Peace and Freedom Party meeting, I thought they were nuts.) \u00a0As I edit this note in 2007, only in recent years, and especially since Al Gore\u2019s\u00a0 film, <em>An Inconvenient Truth<\/em>, have such notions begun to become widespread, although implementing meaningful change still seems elusive.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_ednref11\">[11]<\/a> The climax of all this came a century later with regicide and a novel, albeit brief, period of rule without a monarchy.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_ednref12\">[12]<\/a> The Italian humanist Lorenzo Valla in 1440 exposed this medieval hoax that purported to be from Roman emperor Constantine in the early 4<sup>th<\/sup> century, \u201cdonating\u201d the Roman Empire to the Catholic church.\u00a0 For details, consult e.g. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newadvent.org\/cathen\/05118a.htm\">http:\/\/www.newadvent.org\/cathen\/05118a.htm<\/a>.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_ednref13\">[13]<\/a> Eventually, the contemporary, or \u201cmodern,\u201d mind came to see itself superior to the ancient, most obviously when natural philosophy re-interpreted nature and exposed fallacies of the ancients: consider, for example, Galileo, who by the personal authority of measuring the speed of balls rolling down inclined planes (<em>not <\/em>by dropping things from the Leaning Tower of Pisa) repudiated Aristotle\u2019s ex cathedra affirmation that the heavier an object, the faster it falls.\u00a0 Commentaries on the ancients-moderns controversy include R.

Lovejoy\u2019s <em>The Great Chain of Being<\/em> (New York, 1960) is the classic intellectual history into which the universe of correspondences fits.\u00a0 The most familiar statement for students of Renaissance English literature when I was in graduate school was E. M. W. Tillyard\u2019s <em>The Elizabethan World Picture <\/em>(New York, n.d.); My major problem with Tillyard is that he sees this synthesis as firmly entrenched in the \u201cElizabethan\u201d mind, whereas I believe it is under constant assault from both daily events and the intellectual ferment of the Reformation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"file:\/\/\/F:\/0files%20for%20crashplan\/web%20site\/kompozer\/diss%20intro.html#_ednref15\">[15]<\/a> Pico della Mirandola\u2019s most famous work is <em>On the Dignity of Man<\/em>, for the full text of which see, e.g., <em>The Renaissance Philosophy of Man<\/em>, ed.

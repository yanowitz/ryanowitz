For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019ve made a few comments, but I\u2019m increasingly dubious that whatever I say will actually contribute to conversations, so I\u2019m going to stop such replies for now and instead make this general post.<\/p>\n<p>Given the group name and the guidelines to which I agreed, I expected to be encountering thoughtful lefty critical analysis that would be a refreshing change from the kind of unnuanced thinking I too often find in Facebook political commentaries. But instead, I\u2019m seeing many (not all) posts that rant and vilify as much as our worst enemies. I see generalizations without supporting sources (or in at least one case, a notoriously unreliable source), and I am sometimes confused whether a mean attack is genuine or a bot designed to sow dissension within the left.<\/p>\n<p>I find an enormous amount of repetition with no added light, as in the seemingly never-ending laments about Bernie\u2019s defeat and how wonderful he is. (Yes, it\u2019s sad, but don\u2019t we need to move on and not mire ourselves in an irretrievable past?) And I\u2019m especially disappointed in the should-we-or-shouldn\u2019t-we-vote-for-Biden wrangling. While I haven\u2019t read everything on this theme, what I\u2019ve seen typically sounds identical (with name changes) to quadrennial election comments for the many elections in which I\u2019ve previously voted. (If you want to see my own take, based on often NOT voting for a main party candidate\u2014which depending on your own zeal may or may not moderate this polarization\u2014you can check my blog post at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.richardyanowitz.com\/wordpress\/to-biden-or-not-to-biden\/\">http:\/\/www.richardyanowitz.com\/wordpress\/to-biden-or-not-to-biden\/<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>Just in case this one day\u2019s contributions are a fluke, and they&#8217;re normally much more thotful, I\u2019ll watch for another day or two. But if nothing changes, I shall withdraw from this group (which presumably will please others as well as myself).<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m curious whether anyone else reacts as I have to many of the posts here, or if in this group\u2019s context I\u2019m just a serious misfit. (I\u2019m also wondering whether a lot of the comments are from younger people, for I can imagine myself as having written similar polarizing statements, or repeated laments, in my long ago, youthful political days.) I will respond to posts that seek to be thoughtful, regardless of whether they agree with me, but not to ones that think nuanced argumentation consists of nastiness and righteousness.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today is my first day in this group.

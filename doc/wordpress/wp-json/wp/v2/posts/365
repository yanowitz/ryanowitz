Terrible as these time are, I have imagined that once we\u2019re rid of him and his, our culture will regain important standards it has lost (but not thereby automatically correct the many important longer-term problems that Trump\u2019s advent has perpetuated or worsened).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For three years plus, I\u2019ve tried to steel myself for the seemingly&nbsp;non-stop series of horrible policies and to accept that nothing he or his&nbsp;minions say can be trusted. I\u2019ve tried NOT to read in depth about outrages,&nbsp;large or small. At rare times, when my own ox has been gored (as opposed to, for&nbsp;example, the immoral immigration policies that don\u2019t affect my daily life),&nbsp;I\u2019ve sometimes been forced harshly to recognize my own insulation from much of&nbsp;the prejudicial policies (not just towards people but everything, including the&nbsp;environment) and how much my privilege (especially being able to buy my way out&nbsp;of many deleterious effects) protects me even at the worst of times (so far).&nbsp;I have constantly reminded myself and others that the problem isn\u2019t trump&nbsp;himself but the network of support and manipulation around him (as we have most&nbsp;recently seen clearly in the impeachment trial).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of that has helped me get through the last three years without&nbsp;total depression.&nbsp;I don\u2019t know how I would get through another four. That would&nbsp;take me into my 80s. I expected still to have political issues as I aged, but&nbsp;not like these.*<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>None of that (I hope) has stopped me from hating what has&nbsp;been going on or refusing to collude with it to the extent I have any power in&nbsp;such matters. None of that has spared me from despair, albeit at a large&nbsp;distance, over all the victims, human and otherwise, of this administration,&nbsp;and especially children in cages or stripped from their parents. None of that<br>helps my terror of what his supporters, many of them armed, may do if he gets&nbsp;defeated (when, I assume, he will bluster that he really won the election).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now, in recent days, I\u2019ve had the intuition that many&nbsp;Trumpian effects (even if we avoid another civil war) will indeed have much longer-term&nbsp;durability. On just one level, there are all the permissions to chauvinistic&nbsp;Americans to indulge their prejudices, and it will likely take extended, strong&nbsp;efforts to curtail the resulting behavior. But more generally, I think some of<br>the disregard for a range of &nbsp;social behavior&nbsp;(for which I\u2019ve never been an advocate) traditional courtesies and behavior&nbsp;have been seeping into our population beyond his core supporters (and to some&nbsp;degree other polities around the world). I\u2019ve noticed individual examples that&nbsp;have given me this thought, but I didn\u2019t note them down and at this point don\u2019t&nbsp;remember the details. One that DOES stick in my mind is an event a friend posted&nbsp;about an angry man who pushed over someone in a wheelchair&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.boston.com\/news\/national-news\/2020\/01\/31\/man-thrown-from-wheelchair-for-asking-able-bodied-driver-not-to-park-in-handicapped-space-police-say?fbclid=IwAR2MIG8RwLa6f5d5L1cYQAVgcxM7m0eL-oRkeEBereT6KHiK4pNUYeOrSAs\"><strong>https:\/\/www.boston.com\/news\/national-news\/2020\/01\/31\/man-thrown-from-wheelchair-for-asking-able-bodied-driver-not-to-park-in-handicapped-space-police-say?fbclid=IwAR2MIG8RwLa6f5d5L1cYQAVgcxM7m0eL-oRkeEBereT6KHiK4pNUYeOrSAs<\/strong><\/a>).&nbsp;I suppose this could have happened at any time, but somehow it feels as though people&nbsp;feel more permission (perhaps even an invitation, to vent their anger in ways&nbsp;like this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>___________________________________<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>*I\u2019ve often been struck that \u201cour\u201d side has probably been having&nbsp;agonized feelings similar to those experienced by the pre-Trump right wing.

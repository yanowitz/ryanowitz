<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">At
the time of my mother's death, Hy and I were living in a three-room apartment
at 64 East Fourth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were paying
fourteen dollars a month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some years
before we had placed what furniture we had in storage and never retrieved
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no hot water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We weren't there long enough to find out
about the heat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a kitchen
sink, a tub, a two-burner gas range, an ice box, a double bed, a chest of
drawers, I think; and that was it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of
course, there were multitudes of cockroaches and rats, which probably
contributed to the reason why a "Condemned" sign was pasted on the
front door of the building.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
father took us to our tenement and then went across the street to the grocery
with which we had dealt for about ten years.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Dolinskys were kind people who had carried us when my mother's
illnesses or the tardiness of my father's checks left us destitute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Dolinsky's heavy Jewish accent didn't
hide the fact that he was a thinker.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
had once paid Hy to write a letter to FDR giving his ideas for bringing the
country out of the Depression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
automatically sneered at the idea that a man with a Jewish accent could offer
anything useful to the President of the U.S.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was the same kind of attitude that had made me squirm when my mother,
wearing a clean housedress would come to school during Parents' Week.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
grocery bill was larger than it should have been.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I'd come home from school, I would often stop and get a two
cent banana or a five cent Ward's cake, which was about a four inch square, two
inch deep two-layer chocolate cake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd
also buy milk to make myself a quart of my favorite cold concoction with cocoa
and sugar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd always be on the lookout
for tasties and could never deny myself any.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My mother always managed to pay something to keep the bill from going
through the roof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was there now with
a vengeance&#8211;I think it was close to a hundred dollars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father must have gulped when he took care
of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was an enormous amount
during the Depression, though it bought a heck of a lot of groceries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What sighs of relief the Dolinskys must have
breathed!</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">After
long discussions they recommended a family on the ground floor of 77 East
Fourth, who would probably be willing to accept Sinki as a ward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father and Jean made the arrangements
after some haggling and promising and Hy and I were hopeful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sinki's prognosis had varied from very
negative to the suggestion that, "She may grow out of it."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
father's first attempt to win Hy and me over as his children again followed an
old pattern. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>He took us to a place we'd
never been before though it was very close; a Roumanian Restaurant on Second
Avenue near Fourth Street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sky was
the limit and we could choose what we wish.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The amount of money he was spending got in the way of my enjoyment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had been so poor and this lavish display
offended me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Oh, the food was wonderful
(not as good as Mom's cooking, of course), but I didn't enjoy it.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
guess he tried to keep his promises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
brought Sinki back from Craig Colony and she moved in with her foster
family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother had always said that
Sylvia was his favorite child and I guess her epilepsy was a blow to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The foster family kept her for about two or
three weeks and then gave up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I guess
they liked the money but couldn't handle the problems.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My sister's fits frightened them too much
and they begged off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think my father
tried to find someone else but failed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So he gave up and Sinki went back to Craig Colony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think my father experienced some
difficulty because, while it was a state institution, they tried to collect
money from the families of their patients.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My father didn't want to pay and he succeeded in not doing so.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
don't know if it was the day of the funeral or the day after the funeral that
we met the Glicks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aunt May was my
father's younger sister and her only son, Mike, was being bar-mitzvahed on that
day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother hadn't liked my Aunt May
and accused her, I believe correctly of stealing and destroying some of the
checks for support that my father sent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I think Aunt May must have disliked my mother intensely and felt she
shouldn't get any support.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to
my mother, she'd send Mike to pilfer our mailbox when she knew my father had
sent a check.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never learned whether
my father was a party to this.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">A
while before my mother's death, she had signed a paper agreeing to divorce
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know he resisted paying
anything, but my mother made it very difficult for him to work in New
York.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had him thrown into prison
for non-support often.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That's probably
why he went to work for Uncle Irving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
guess in frustration he finally paid the munificent sum of fifteen hundred
dollars to be free of her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The money
was supposed to be divided equally among the children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have no way of accounting as to how it
became supposedly three hundred apiece.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I'm reasonably sure that I got my three hundred and used it to buy a
1930 DeSoto for forty-five dollars and take a trip to Florida with Hy and my
friend, Sammy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sinki's money went into
the bank under her name and she never got to use it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Minki never learned anything about her share.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
bar-mitzvah was a golden opportunity for my father to introduce his children to
the family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was quite a crowd at
the Glicks' home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a kissing
crowd, and I succumbed unwillingly to many sloppy lips applied with some vigor
to parts of my face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The women were bad
enough, and some of the men weren't terrible, but my Uncle Max (a generation
removed) slobbered and smacked and was kind of revolting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I discovered later he liked boys.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nobody seemed to be bothered about
homosexuality&#8211;or about sexuality, for that matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I only discovered two other cases besides Uncle Max, but I was
never really close to the inner grapevine.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Everybody exclaimed rapturously about how much I looked like my father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were great aunts and uncles and
various types of cousins&#8211;first, second, third&#8211;I couldn't keep count.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
Aunt May was the Mother Superior of the Glick household.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She ran it with a shrill voice and a velvet
glove.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her husband Dave would complain
as unpleasantly as possible, but she had her way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had five children.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When my father finally took Minki out of the HOA, he placed her with
Aunt May.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mink wasn't happy there; she
was treated as a slavey.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a couple
of years, he brought her down to live in what he hoped to make a permanent home
in Memphis, Tennessee where he had opened a gift shop.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Flo,
the oldest of Aunt Mae's<span style="">&nbsp; </span>children,
was<span style="">&nbsp; </span>married to Sam, an asthmatic.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After my father's gift shop in Memphis
failed, he went back on the road with Jean and arranged for Flo and Sam to
board Minki, which they did for quite a number of years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had two children, Sonny and Myra, and
Mink grew to be quite fond of them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, Flo also made a slavey of her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mink liked Sam who treated her very nicely, but she ran away from their
home twice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Eastern climate became
unbearable to Sam and he had to move to Colorado.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He got involved with a woman out there and wrote to ask Flo for a
divorce.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I guess she must have gotten
some kind of settlement and since she was a rather attractive woman was quickly
grabbed up by a high school sweetheart, Harry, a five-by-five cab driver who
was very glib and knew how to inflate taxi fares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He died about ten years ago and Flo married someone whose name I
don't know.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Ruthie
was the second daughter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was the
ravishing one and she knew it!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alas,
too late.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she was sixteen she
married Sid Zwirn, who was about thirty-six at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was a baker and made good money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had three children&#8211;that is three
children were raised in the household.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There were Bunny, Merry and Francy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Bunny and Merry were probably Sid's.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ruthie was probably the first female I ever heard who said,
"fuck" with relish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also
read every pornographic book I became acquainted with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember talking to her about <i>The Lives
and Loves of Frank Harris</i>, one of the literati who enjoyed
cunnilingus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She would tease her
husband about her boy-friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bunny
grew up chubby and good-natured, Merry was pretty, but, horrors! married a Christian
boy, and Francie was born cross-eyed but had a terrific, outgoing personality,
a real stage presence, and eventually married a psychiatrist with somewhere
between four and eight children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sidney
died when Ruthie was about fifty and<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ruthie remarried some years later and moved to Florida.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
think I had been away in Florida with Hy and Sammy for a few months, and when I
visited the Zwirn household I was shocked at Ruthie's appearance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was pregnant and her pretty face was
bloated almost beyond recognition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
body was acceptably enlarged, but I had never seen such fat lips and fat cheeks
on her before.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Sylvia
came next.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was finer featured than
Flo, but no great shakes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She copied
Ruthie's mannerisms and eventually married Abie, who might be described as a
petty hood involved in the numbers rackets and gambling in general.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was a pleasant fellow, who, I understood,
could be very unpleasant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was-dark
featured and slim when I met him and in later life, after his divorce from
Sylvia, became fatfaced and fatbodied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He had a great head for figures and I remember his son Butchie, while
about five or six, immediately giving answers to problems like 367 times
4733.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's still hard for me to
believe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He grew up to run a bagel
shop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't remember much about Rita
except that her father's later years of chubbiness showed up in her at an early
age and lasted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her disposition was
delightful.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Joel was born while Abie
was in jail for something he got caught at.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The kid was interested, I understand, in the same kinds of things I used
to be&#8211;nature, tropical fish, plants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
eventually blossomed into a homosexual.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then there was Stevie, who today is a travel agent in Israel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sylvia also married a man with a Santa Claus
figure after her divorce.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She has a bad
heart valve and has had open-heart surgery twice.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Elsie
and I were closest in age; and when I went to Morris High School at night to
try to finish up so I could graduate, she went with me for a while.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her birthday was the twenty-eighth of
October, which, I guess, made it easier to become friendly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She introduced me to her circle of friends
and her second cousin (and mine), Miltie Ershowsky, whom she loved madly.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Among
Elsie's friends were a few second cousins of mine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was Flo Pullman, with whom I had something going for a
while, though my naivete and her giggling never reached any fruition outside of
some labored kissing and sneaky kitzels which were repulsed with wide-eyed
shocked disapproval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Solly Pullman was
the son of Joe Pullman, my granduncle, who was the twin brother of Sam Pullman
who was married to the twin sister of Joe Pullman's wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Solly Pullman was Joe Pullman's son, and
somehow my second cousin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The strain on
homosexuality showed up in him also.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was a very pleasant, friendly fellow.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Sally
something-or-other was also a numerical cousin of mine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was a bright chipper sparrow of a
girl.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It gave her a kick to steal me
from Flo.She induced me to take her rowing in Central Park in the late evening
and I sat on her seat and we kissed a few times and she rapturously told me of
her dire plan and how angry Flo was going to be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I guess I should have felt chipper because of the value placed
upon my delectability, but I felt used instead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't redate Sally, though I met her and her two kids some
years later when her husband unloaded a 1936 Hudson Terraplane on me.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Miltie
was a year or so younger than Elsie and resisted her wiles for a while, but she
was indomitable and he finally gave in.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were a nice couple.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mae and
I went to their wedding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Elsie was
beautiful in a wide, white wedding gown and Miltie was handsome.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Ershowsky family was famous in New York
for their provisions (Salami, pastrami, corned beef)&#8211;the gantze megillah.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could usually count on Miltie for a
sandwich during my hungry years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
never had any children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They sold their
business in New York and moved to Florida joining Ruthie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Elsie died of cancer and Miltie married
again.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Mike
was Aunt Mae's fourth child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He dreamed
of becoming a wheeler-dealer like his brother-in-law, Abie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had the personality, but not the talent,
and so followed his father into the ILGWU and became a business agent, no doubt
through his father's connections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
wasn't strange, even then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jobs and
advancement came through nepotism ninety percent of the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mike was skinny to the point of
gauntness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His father was skinny also,
but his father was a little over five feet tall, while Mike was close to
six.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He married a very nice girl named
Zelda, a trifle more than pleasingly plump, but also possessing a delightful,
cheerful personality.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Harriet
was the last child of Aunt May's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
was a child of the sixties though she was born in the thirties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She refused to be called Harriet and became
Terri.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was wild and free and copied
all her sisters' worst habits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
attractive, became a model, possibly a call girl, had Christian boy friends,
and died of an overdose, possibly suicide, before she was twenty.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Uncle
Dave died in his sixties and Aunt May followed him about ten years later, in
her seventies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They both died of heart
disease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Flo is 72 now and that means
that Ruthie is 69, and Sylvia must be 67.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I've known them as people, cousins, for nigh on fifty years.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
father's family were card players; particularly pinochle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whenever they got together in my Aunt May's
house, Uncle Dave would bring out the cards and the game would begin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father smoked cigars throughout the night
and they would play a talking game.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Uncle Irving kept up a sing-song monotone referring to each play in a
kind of talmudic dissertation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
would make comments deprecating somebody else's play.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They would argue, condemn whoever was their partner. (In
three-hand pinochle, two players are always trying to defeat the bidder), and
would joyfully slap their cards down when taking a trick.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My uncle Dave was a sneerer; a small man,
but aggressive, and a bit of a cheat.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When laying out a meld, one card would be partially hidden behind
another and quickly shuffled back into the hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He always had to be checked.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The stakes were low, but winning was everything.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Whatever
women there were in the house had to cater to the needs of the men in between
the poker or canasta games that they were involved in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were never quiet games; always roars
of derisive laughter, agonized groans of dismay, angry accusations, tinkling
cups and glasses, crying of children&#8211;it was a circus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I watched, I learned, and I sat in when they needed a third or a
fourth, and boy, did I get jeered at for stupid mistakes!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It rings in my ears:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"How could you do that?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Didn't you see what I led?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You threw away the hand!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Oh, boy, how they built my confidence!</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
Uncle Irving was married to my Aunt Etta, who had the most repulsive, dry skin
I ever had to kiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Kissing was almost
Frenchlike in my father's family.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whenever I kissed her cheek, I got a strong feeling that she hated it as
much as I, but custom prevailed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
compound the felony, she never returned any kisses, she would just offer her
cheek.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was not an unkind
woman&#8211;perhaps she had some skin affliction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their son was Martin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he
became a practicing C.P.A, the family name was changed to Young because it was
not Jewish sounding, which might have cost Marty customers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hitler's anti-semitic propaganda had a heavy
effect here in the thirties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Uncle
Irving invested in the stock market and in East Side tenement buildings, and
probably made a good deal of money that way.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">His
primary business was called "The Gotham Premium Novelty
Company."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father was one of his
crew bosses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crews would go to a
southern state and convince cotton mill employees and their wives that they
should sell chances on a "pull-book."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When all the chances were sold, the seller would have collected
somewhere around twelve dollars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
would be one winner who could choose a chenille bedspread, a bathrobe, a vanity
set, a blanket, or any one of several other premiums; and the seller would
receive a box of toilet articles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
uncle and his partner, Sokoloff, made a great deal of money by selling in
quantity.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
father explained to me that he ran his crew from Birmingham, Alabama, and that
he was going to take me down there to live with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the explanation, though he never made any introduction per
se, it became apparent that Jean was his wife.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
don't know why that bit of information had such an impact on me, but that night
I went on a drunken crying jag in front of Benny and Sammy, my two best friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They couldn't tell why I was disturbed,
either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are probably a thousand
pat answers&#8211;maybe the inner-me wanted an unattached father.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">At
the time of Abie's and Mama's deaths, Mink was at the HOA's camp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she came back, I was still staying at
the Lavenberg Corner House.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a treat
I took her and Sinki out for a holiday.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I warned Sinki not to tell Minki about any of the deaths.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Mink
was twelve then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For some reason or
other, Sinki made an excuse to speak to Minki on the side and told her about
the death of her twin brother, Irving.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mink was terribly shocked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
thought something was wrong and asked her what the matter was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was so frightened about what she thought
I would do to Sinki, because Sinki had told her not to tell me, that she just
shook her head; and since I had taken them out for a holiday, I let it go.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">A
short while later Hy visited Mink and told her about all three deaths.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mink fainted.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
father finally took Mink out of the home and had her board at Aunt May's
home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mink felt that she was being
treated like a slavey and became very unhappy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Some notice must have been taken of this because she was then placed in
Flo's home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It turned out to be a
change from one overseer to another.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The only difference was that Sam treated her nicely, and she became very
fond of Myra and Sonny, the two children.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
father and Jean had to go back to Birmingham, Alabama, to get his crew started
working.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said he would send for me
as soon as he got things started.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
arranged for Uncle Irving to pay Flo four dollars a week for Mink's board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eventually Mink went to work at the Gotham
Premium Novelty Company for four dollars a week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After working for too long a period at that wage, my sister asked
for a raise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Uncle Irving shunted her
off by telling her to ask Sokaloff.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Enough nagging got Sokaloff to pay her three dollars more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Flo found this out, she demanded that
Mink pay her two more dollars for her board.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Mink's
success with Sokaloff gave her enough confidence so that by the time she was
sweet sixteen she had noodjehd him to raise her pay all the way up to ten
dollars a week!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had, in the
interim, run away from Flo twice but had to return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, when it grew more and more apparent that her career did
not lie with Gotham, she saved a little money, quit her job and quit Flo's
house, and got her first sewing job at sixteen dollars a week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a job with a greater potential
also.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Sokaloff found out how much
she was making, he was flabbergasted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Who's going to pay you sixteen dollars a week to work?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's impossible!" he said.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
don't know why, but my father had to go to Washington, D.C. and he arranged to
meet me there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I traveled by train to
Union Station, met him there, went to watch the Nine Old Men, listened to a
boring Supreme Court in session, and then continued by train to Birmingham,
Alabama.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was my first acquaintance
with Jim Crow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Segregated cars weren't
bad&#8211;if you were white.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
father let me order all the southern fried chicken I wanted to at my first
restaurant meal in Birmingham.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
finally had to give up&#8211;I wouldn't quit.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
stayed at the Brothers' boarding house, which was run by Mrs. Brothers, a
widow, with the help of her two teenage sons.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was genteel, as was one of her sons; but Charlie was deep down mean
and ugly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He loved to tell stories
about lynchings and scatological tales about his travels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had run away to New Orleans once and
delved into the seamier perversions that he swore he had witnessed.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">One
horror tale, that he had or had not witnessed, concerned "this big, black
buck who had done something that got the Klan sore, so they caught him, sat him
down on a stump of a tree, nailed his balls to the stump with a big spike,
piled brush 'round him, gave him a knife, and set fire to the brush.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had to cut or burn."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when I asked the all-too-obvious
question Charlie would chortle with glee and say, "He did what you'd
do," and I'd just about sicken and die.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
father was a bit put out by my East Side New York manners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, Southern politeness started to rub
off on me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I learned to say,
"Please pass the okra, black-eyed peas, and other strange fodder that was
available.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I liked to eat so I learned
early to like what I was eating.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
always got a kick out of experimenting.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
went to Phillips High School in Birmingham.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It wasn't the same as going to school in the North.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The American History teacher seemed to take
pleasure in trying to embarrass me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
called me a "Yankee," but it always sounded like
"Damnyankee" when he said it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I didn't make any friends; I guess I didn't know the code words.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One girl really laced it into me for being
so stand-offish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was Jewish, and I
guess young, handsome, Jewish boys were at a premium.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt totally at a loss under her lip-lash, and I would have
been happy to have done something to stop her tears, but I was not, as yet, a
sophisticate in the art of handling women.</p>

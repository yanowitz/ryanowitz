<p class="MsoNormal">Just over two weeks ago my father died, the day after
Thanksgiving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His death was neither a
surprise nor unwelcome.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For roughly ten
years he had increasingly debilitating dementia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the later years if not carefully observed, he would wander out
of the house to destinations the purpose of which only his own mind could
understand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He took anti-psychotic (and
many other) drugs because he was prone to paranoia, especially in the evening
(sundowning), sometimes he would even mistrust his wife, and once several
months ago he hit her in his delusion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was incontinent off and on in recent years, and was steadily so in
the closing months of his life (this, I believe, was the single hardest thing
for my mother to deal with.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had
long since forgotten his grandchildren.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For years when he saw me he would ask what I did for a living and
whether I had children.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In early September, my mother sold their condo in a
retirement community called Clearbrook in Cranbury, NJ, where they had lived
for 20 years, and rented a one-bedroom apartment in Highland Park, NJ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had been trying to sell the home for a
long time&#8212;a year, I think.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She sensed
that much as she tried to forestall the day, it was getting close to the time
when Dad would need to go into a nursing home, and the one with which many
years ago she had put him (and herself) on a waiting list was a long drive from
Clearbrook but within a few miles of Highland Park.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mother had taught in Highland Park High School for many years,
where she had been chair of the English department and head of her union; my
parents had owned a home in the town, and I believe to that extent it was a
welcome, familiar place for her move.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I helped on the day of the move and stayed a couple of days
after to unpack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dad had trouble
remembering where things were in the new home, including the bathroom, but he
had already become similarly disoriented in the Clearbrook home<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His loss of knowledge of that home was one
of the reasons Mother could allow them to make the move.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Still, while I unpacked, he would sit in the living room and
watch DVDs of musicals he had always enjoyed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While he could remember almost nothing of his past, he was often able to
sing along with the songs in the movies; and one time he commented on how good
an actor the king&#8217;s son was in the Kerr-Brynner version of <i>The King and I</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On a couple of occasions, seemingly out of
the blue, he said to me, &#8220;I love you.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I expect this was in response to my helping Mom, and maybe just because
I was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not the sort of
thing he said in his better days, and I was surprisingly (to me) touched.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Aside from when he was watching musicals, I found he still
had some vestige of rationality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
time when he wandered into the bedroom in quest of the bathroom (which was down
a separate hall) and asked me where the bathroom was, instead of answering I
asked casually, &#8220;Does this look like the bathroom?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He looked around, seemed to realized it <i>didn&#8217;t </i>look like a
bathroom, and left the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then
tried the appropriate hall and found the bathroom.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">During these days he tried wandering off, once
successfully.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Clearbrook, Mom had
long since installed an alarm system that sounded when he opened the front
door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While this sometimes woke her
early in the morning when he apparently wanted to get the newspaper from the
front stoop, on the whole I gather he understood that he was waking her and
discontinued the effort after a few tries.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But in the new apartment, the alarm was not yet installed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I thought it would take a specialist to
install it, but my brother-in-law Alan was able to figure it out when he
visited a few days later.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first
time Dad wandered off neither Mom nor I realized for some time, probably 15
minutes or longer, and when we did realize we searched frantically for him for
several minutes until he arrived in the elevator to his floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another elderly man had apparently helped
him, and when the man saw Mom and me he began to berate us for not keeping a
better eye on Dad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thanked the man
for his help and then asked him not to lecture us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After that, Dad would still manage to start disengaging the
various locks&#8212;he succeeded at least once&#8212;but made enough noise doing so that
either Mom or I would hear and stop him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When I told him once, firmly, &#8220;You can&#8217;t go out of the
apartment on your own,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;So I&#8217;m a prisoner here, huh?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This statement struck me for both the
rationality of the response and the instinct for independence.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Within a month of this move, Mother phoned my sister and me
one day to seek our counsel because Dad was starting to fall down and she
wasn&#8217;t strong enough to hold him up or pick him up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agreed with her conclusion that the time had come to put him
in a nursing home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was hard for
her&#8212;she had resisted outside help (other than from her children) throughout his
decline&#8212;but she now had the justification that trying to care for him at home
would put him in more danger than being in a nursing home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her apartment wasn&#8217;t set up to hire someone
to live in and look after him even if that were financially or emotionally
feasible.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This decision came on a Thursday or Friday, and although he
was at the top of the list for the nursing home (and in fact a bed had just
opened up&#8212;a memory on which I mused when he died and his bed became available
once again), it was going to take a few days to be ready to admit him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t know what the issues were, but Mom
had to hold out for a few days longer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judi
went to Clearbrook for one day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I chose
to stay in Madison, CT, where I was now living virtually full-time:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was rehearsing Willy Loman, I had already
missed a rehearsal when I helped Mom with the move, and it was desperately
important to me to work on the role.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whether this was the morally correct decision I leave to others to
judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What I did do was drive to NJ to
help Mom on the day and day after Dad was going into the home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Regardless of whether I should have gone
earlier, it was clearly a good thing that I went when I did.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Dad declined rapidly in the nursing home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;ll never know if he was going to do so
regardless, but I expect that institutionalization sped the process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The day we moved him I was struck by the
glazed looks of so many of the residents, whom I tend to think of as inmates,
the almost universal confinement to wheelchairs, and the number of residents
dozing in those wheelchairs while placed in front of a large-screen TV in a
common room.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Dad was barely able to walk when he went in, but at some
level I admired his determination to walk at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clinging to his walker, he would move one foot a couple of
inches, then the other, and so on for however long it took to get
anywhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(That evening Mother and I
left him and went to a Highland Park restaurant, Charley Brown&#8217;s, for dinner;
as we walked from the car to the restaurant we commented on the freedom of
being able to move at our own pace.)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But in the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>home they put him in
a wheelchair and, I gather, gave up on having him walk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What employee could be bothered to wait for
him?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result, he apparently gave up
trying to walk even during Mom&#8217;s daily visits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At times, however, he would try to stand and walk away from the
wheelchair, to which the home responded by strapping him in and keeping him
near the nurse&#8217;s station so he couldn't disappear on them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">He became violent at times.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mother chafed when she learned the home charged an extra $2 a day (among
many charges for &#8220;extras&#8221;) for incontinent residents, but in my mind it was her
greatest freedom when he entered the home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When staff would try to clean him up, he would sometimes lash out with
his arms and fight the effort.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
tendency towards violence when I was a child had left deep psychic scars in me,
but I could scarcely blame him now: although perhaps driven by lifelong habits,
in this context it seemed instinctual and beyond his rational control; and
presumably the staff treated him with minimal concern for his feelings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(On the day he entered the home, I had the
general impression that on the whole the staff was competent and trained up to
a point but unimaginative and secure only when following written or unwritten
rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also thought: what do we
expect for the salaries they must get paid when the home can charge just $80 a
day&#8212;though every extra cost extra&#8212;to the residents?)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Staff also complained because sometimes he cursed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both Mother and I found this complaint
ludicrous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely their daily non-work
lives were not immune to such language, and in any event how could they get
upset at cursing from someone in Dad&#8217;s condition?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And how could they expect anyone to get him to control himself?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Incidents like these&#8212;violence, swearing&#8212;caused uneasiness in
me, however, and I assume in Mom lest the home invoke its 30-day notice right
to kick him out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was in despair at
the thought of what we would do in such a case, and I tried to live in denial
that this was a possibility.</p>

<p class="stblcolhdr"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">December 26, 2003</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">While he was in the nursing home, my father&#8217;s primary doctor
now became someone retained by the home, but his specialists remained unchanged
and my mother sometimes still had to take him to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was grueling for her to take him
anywhere; he had to be helped at both ends.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Several years earlier, doctors had inserted a shunt to help
his blood flow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The theory was that his
dementia was being speeded up by slow blood flow to the brain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We never knew if the shunt helped or if the
trauma of the operation was worse than any benefit the shunt provided, and
Mother, Judi and I had all agreed that we would be extremely reluctant to put
him through an operation again.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">But during these doctor&#8217;s visits after going into the
nursing home, Mom was informed that the shunt seemed to be blocked and that a
relatively brief operation&#8212;one hour&#8212;should free up the flow again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a long shot whether this would help
him, but Mother and I&#8212;I&#8217;m not sure how Judi felt&#8212;agreed that the risks were
minimal and the potential benefit, while of dubious odds, was worth the
effort.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Around early November he had
the operation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was frustrated about
the timing; <i>Death of a Salesman </i>would be playing for one weekend, and I
wanted Mother to come to Connecticut to see it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Though I said at first it was for her to be able to see a son
perform, I realized that I, too, wanted her to see me&#8212;as I said to her, &#8220;What son
doesn&#8217;t want to show off to a parent?&#8221;)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I was angry that she might not work the schedule out so that
she would feel able to come.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was
initial trouble to schedule, and then, when the schedule would apparently have
allowed her to come to the play, there was some mix-up about the date or requirements
for the operation, and the date was postponed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To me, this was one more example of Dad&#8217;s needs dominating my
mother&#8217;s&#8212;and my&#8212;life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought maybe
Mom welcomed the excuse not to come, since the trip would be arduous and she
was, after all, 84.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But she did come:
the operation was on a Wednesday, I think; she took Amtrak from NJ to New Haven
to arrive on Saturday; while I performed in a matinee, Maxine picked her up and
then brought her to the evening performance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She went home the next day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
it happened, the Saturday evening performance, I thought, was my best.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A week or two after the operation, Dad developed a fever and
cough.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Within a couple of days&#8212;we were
now about a week before Thanksgiving&#8212;the doctor of the nursing home (I think
based on nursing reports, not his own visit to Dad) had him transferred to St.
Peter&#8217;s Hospital, a short distance (half-mile?) away, also in New
Brunswick.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was diagnosed with a
pneumonia that resulted from poor swallowing: he was aspirating food and drink into
his lungs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was put on an IV.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was taking several medications to deal
with blood flow, psychosis, the sundowning, depression, who knows what.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only one of these, apparently, could be
administered by IV.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mother was with him
much of the time, and she had to deal with his constantly trying to pull out
the IV and to get out of the bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was thrashing a lot; I assumed this was at least in part because of going cold
turkey on some of the drugs.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Test results early in Thanksgiving week were bleak.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His vital systems were weak.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was, in effect, dying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judi, Mother and I had long since agreed not
to use so-called &#8220;heroic&#8221; measures to keep him alive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He and Mother had both made living wills to this effect.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A question arose about a breathing tube: getting
one might ease his pain, but it might also become &#8220;permanent&#8221; and keep him
alive when the rest of his body had given up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In general, despite the crucifix in his room at St. Peter&#8217;s,
Mother seemed to find hospital staff and behavior sensitive and helpful, a
welcome change from what seemed her constant conflicts at other times with most
medical personnel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A geriatric female
doctor visited Mother and asked what she wanted for Dad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mom said to minimize his pain and let him be
peaceful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m not sure death was ever
mentioned, but when Mom told me about this, I gradually realized that what was
being discussed was letting him die.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(When recounting the conversation with the geriatric specialist, Mother
commented with a mixture of facetiousness and irony, &#8220;Apparently I gave the
right answer.&#8221;)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On, I think, the day
before Thanksgiving Dad was put on a morphine drip.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Maxine&#8217;s daughters and significant others had come to our
Madison home for Thanksgiving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had
tried hard, and (somewhat to my surprise) largely with success, not to be
gloomy during the festivities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did
phone Mom at the hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dad was now,
finally, sleeping peacefully, relaxed, not thrashing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mother said she had been sitting there feeling thankful for two
things (I only realized later &#8220;thankful&#8221; was in the context of the holiday):
that he was now peaceful, and that her children were so supportive.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I think she badly needed us children to agree with the
decision to let him die.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Regardless of
how much she rationally knew it was the right thing, she still felt she was
killing him; and for Mother, not being able to count on reason&#8217;s trumping
emotion has always been hard to bear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">He never woke again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When we had learned that he was dying, we agreed to wait until after
Thanksgiving to tell friends and relatives other than immediate family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On Friday morning, November 28, 2003, I
awoke around 6&#8212;sleep, difficult at the best of times, had been especially
elusive of late, and I had been taking Ambien nightly for a few weeks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since I was up, I began composing e-mail to
explain to friends and family what was happening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I finished a draft, I decided to check his latest status.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I called the St. Peter&#8217;s nursing station for
his floor, and when I explained what that I wanted a status update, the nurse
who answered asked me to hold on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
realized he must have died, and sure enough, after 2 or 3 minutes a male doctor
came on the line.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Did he die?&#8221; I
asked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I have long objected to the
need for euphemisms about death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Your
father passed away a few minutes ago.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I apparently phoned just as Dad had died; the doctor had not even phoned
Mom yet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctor asked if I&#8217;d like
to call her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I hesitated and then told
him to call because she might have questions that I wouldn't be able to
answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The doctor asked if the hospital could do an autopsy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said that I would answer yes because I
knew Dad would want it&#8212;he had even referred to such a possibility when he was
alive&#8212;and that he could tell Mother I said that if it would help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She, too, however, knew that Dad would have
wanted it, and okayed it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later she
regretted the decision, though I&#8217;m not sure exactly why&#8212;the spookiness of it,
the possible delay in having his body cremated and so a delay in getting closure,
or something else.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Days later we
learned that the autopsy was performed later that same Friday.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I assume I phoned Judi, and before long I had talked with
Mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can&#8217;t remember the sequence
of who called whom, except that Judi and Alan agreed to go to Highland Park
right away, and I said I would come from Connecticut a little later that
morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it somehow took me 2
or 3 hours to get out of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was disoriented and had trouble organizing myself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maxine, I think, packed some clothes for me in case I stayed
overnight in NJ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Knowing that Mother
had Judi and Alan to be with, I took time to adapt the e-mail I had been
composing and send it out to several people to report Dad&#8217;s death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anthony made me an omelet for breakfast and
a turkey sandwich to take on the drive.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I really didn&#8217;t want to drive, or drive by myself, and had
Maxine&#8217;s children not been visiting I might have let her drive me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it was, I felt nervous about whether I
was making the right&#8212;the sane&#8212;decision to drive myself, and I asked Anthony to
let me talk through what I was thinking and give me feedback.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the process I realized that I was, in
fact, okay to drive; and I also realized, and said to him, that I had now put
him in a lousy position&#8212;that if I <i>did</i> have any kind of accident on the
drive, he would at some level feel culpable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I tried hard to reduce any responsibility on his part, but I was sure I
wasn&#8217;t entirely successful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The drive,
however, went without mishap.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">As I&#8217;ve done since we bought the Connecticut home, I
listened to a book on tape while driving to NJ&#8212;<i>Jarhead</i> by Anthony
Swofford.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was probably too painful
for me at this time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I listened for
awhile, turned on music, reflected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
trip should normally take 2 ½ hours; I think it was closer to three, with some
stop-and-go traffic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the Merritt
Parkway, in a traffic jam, I began thinking about my father&#8217;s memoirs and the
gulf between his aspirations as a child and the reality of his adulthood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His memoirs are entirely about his young
life; my mother, embarrassed at who knows what might be revealed, insisted that
he not write about anything after they knew each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought: when we scatter his ashes, we
should do it in Van Cortlandt Park, which since childhood I knew was his
childhood escape from one or another Lower East Side tenement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought about his own victimhood as a
child and how, in my eyes, he had been unable to overcome it as an adult.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His mother died in a hospital of
tuberculosis when he was 17, and years early when I read the memoir account of
this event I realized that he thought he had killed her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mother later confirmed that he had been
tormented by that belief all his adult life.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">He wanted a happy family, but he was a tyrannical and
abusive father, loving his children intensely but unable to get past his own
demons and let his love override his rage when we weren&#8217;t as he wanted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His children never went hungry, as he had
sometimes done, but I was always conscious as a child of living on the edge of
poverty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never thought we would in
fact go hungry; I just always had the sense that having enough money&#8212;or not
having it&#8212;was a significant issue for my parents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In July or August of 1971 I found some poetry he had written, and
I was struck with how profoundly depressed he was and probably always had
been.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the mid-90s I began taking
anti-depressants, and they profoundly improved my life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have wondered what they would have done
for his life had they been available.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">He tried several &#8220;careers&#8221;&#8212;chicken farming, furrier,
peddling eggs on a route to homes within a 50-mile or larger radius, home
landscaping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his late 30s, while
working full-time at the frozen custard stand we owned, he studied and passed a
high school equivalency exam in U.S. history, applied and entered college,
received a BA in 3 years (attending year-round), and became a junior-high
school teacher for the rest of his working life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being who was, his seemed largely unhappy as a teacher, saying it
was worth putting up with the misery to have the long summer vacation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He chose to work with the hardest age, and,
I gathered, his pupils were mostly unappreciative of his efforts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How he performed in the classroom I never
knew.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In parallel with my father&#8217;s return to schooling, my mother,
who had a couple of years at CCNY, herself went back to college and became a
high school English teacher.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
example of not giving up, of being ever ready to change one&#8217;s lot in life, was
a powerful example to me, and though I said this to my parents more than once,
I don&#8217;t think they ever took it in.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Thoughts like these were going through my mind as I inched
along the Merritt Parkway that day of his death, and I became teary as I
reflected on the unfairness of his childhood and my own inability to forgive
him, or at least not to feel rage towards him, for how he had treated me when I
was a child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These reflections turned
out to be the start of a process that reached a climax 10 days later when we
scattered his ashes in Van Cortlandt Park.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For all I know this process actually extended back decades, but probably
only in the sense that all historical moments can be traced backward
indefinitely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For me, I think his death
was breaking an emotional logjam: I hadn&#8217;t felt able to afford to let go of my
fury, of which I became conscious in my thirties, and at some level clung to it
to continue to punish him for his abuse (as a child, I unconsciously achieved
this punishment by constant sulking, which drove both my parents but especially
him to distraction), and then seeming lack of repentance for how he had treated
me. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>A process was now beginning that
would not lead to my forgiving him&#8212;I&#8217;m not sure I even know what that would
look like&#8212;but to mourning the losses he and I both suffered in our failure to
connect deeply as father and son.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Somewhere during the drive I talked on my cell phone to Judi
at the hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had just viewed
Dad&#8217;s body and said that the staff wanted to know if they should hold the body
for my viewing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knew at once I didn&#8217;t
want to see his body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Part, or most, of
that was squeamishness about seeing a corpse.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But I couldn't believe it would do anything to help me, and I think at
some intuitive level I had seen enough of Dad in terrible physical shape for so
many years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mother got on the phone and
reassured me, with strong feeling, that it was fine if I didn&#8217;t want to see
him&#8212;that thinking she would never have the chance again she had chosen to see
her mother&#8217;s body and largely regretted the decision.</p>

<p class="stblcolhdr"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">December 30, 2003</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">After I arrived at Mother&#8217;s, she and Judi and Alan and I
spent much time making plans.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
ordered pizza for dinner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mood took
wide swings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We decided to have a
memorial ceremony for Dad in the next few days, first meeting in Van Cortlandt
Park (an idea Mom had independently) and then going to Judi&#8217;s for food and a
chance for people to say something about Dad.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I mentioned in passing that I was going to have to work on figuring out
how to say something that was neither hypocritical nor disruptive.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The next day we moved the event a week later, to a week from
Sunday: there was a question of when the ashes would be ready, and various
people who wanted to attend could more easily come at that time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was annoyed, but I think that was a
function of my own need to get closure.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The following week moved very slowly for me; I felt as
though whatever mourning I was going to do was being held in limbo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps to fill the time I composed an
announcement, then an agenda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought
I was going out my way to consult with everyone (Mother, Judi, Alan, Maxine,
David, Steviann&#8212;all by e-mail; David and Steviann were in Arizona on the
weekend after Dad died, but when they returned to LA I included them in the
e-mail discussions) to get agreement on what we would do and what each document
should say, and I was surprised when Judi in particular seemed cold to what I
was doing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Late in the process Maxine
pointed out that what I was really doing was giving people hassles, forcing
them to read at length and make minute decisions when they didn&#8217;t want to be bothered
by minutiae.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I probably could have
prepared nothing and the event would have gone just as well.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A major snowstorm was headed our way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We kept putting off the decision about
exactly what to do about the ceremony.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On Saturday we decided to defer the ash-scattering and on Sunday to
convene at Judi&#8217;s for the food and memorial statements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>David wanted to scatter the ashes the
following Wednesday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could not bear
the thought of being in Manhattan at Maxine&#8217;s one-bedroom apartment that long,
and I also felt annoyed at the way I perceived David as having a habit of
calling shots based on his convenience.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(I also had parked at a Connecticut train station and assumed I had a
huge digging-out job facing me there.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
said I couldn't promise to be present then, that I would return to Connecticut
on Monday and that if I felt up to the drive on Wed., I would drive down to Van
Cortlandt Park.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>David wanted me to
attend, and Judi insisted on it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
ended up agreeing to scatter the ashes Monday morning, after which I would
catch a train to Madison.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">During the days before the ceremony there was a sub-drama, a
family power struggle involving Rebecca.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Most of us felt Mimi, who lived in Montana, should come if she
could.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But early in the week before the
ceremony, Rebecca apparently told her not to.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My first temptation was to leave this alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Mother in particular felt Mimi should come, and because she
believed Dad would have wanted it she offered to pay the air fare.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I called Iris (I can&#8217;t remember if I
called Rebecca first), who told me that when Rebecca told Mimi not to come Mimi
cried.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This news pressed me to push for
Mimi&#8217;s presence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m not sure how
clearly her mind was functioning&#8212;she had had a stroke a couple of years earlier
that hampered her speech&#8212;but she was clearly broken up about her brother&#8217;s
death and wanted to be present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So Iris
and I agreed that she, Iris, would check whether medically it would be OK for
Mimi to fly, and if so Iris would arrange the flight.</p>

<p class="stblpara">I don&#8217;t think Rebecca was happy about this; the next time I
spoke with her, about general arrangements, she seemed especially cold to
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, with the snow storm in the
offing, she had Mimi cancel her flight.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When we learned of this, Iris and I again consulted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She managed to find a replacement
flight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It meant driving Mimi a few
hours to another airport in Montana, but Iris insisted the family was used to
the drive and would take the opportunity to have a day out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it happened, the snow in the east was so
bad that the flight was cancelled.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ironically, however, the original flight Mimi would have taken would
likely have landed&#8212;David and Steviann had a flight from LA that arrived about
the same time Mimi&#8217;s flight would have, and it landed without trouble.</p>

<p class="stblcolhdr"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Jan. 6, 2004</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A few days ago Mother told me that Rebecca recently visited
and &#8220;explained&#8221; that other forces had been at work, including the cancellation
of the second flight not because of closure at La Guardia but closure of some
stopover airport en route&#8212;maybe Minneapolis&#8212;and that changing planes, required
to get from Montana to NY, was too hard on Mimi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I still don&#8217;t think Rebecca should have let Mimi decide what she
wanted to endure&#8212;especially since Rebecca had arranged for her mother to visit
NY a few weeks later.)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Perhaps it is especially fitting that such family dynamics
should play themselves out at a time like this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we had the ceremony, we dialed Mimi and Iris via a
speaker-phone, and they were able to listen to (and participate in) the entire
event.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Jason recorded the Sunday ceremony on a digital device and,
as I write, is planning to burn CDs to distribute to people who want them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I won&#8217;t try here to cover what was
said.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But there was a dynamic that is
worth recording.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>David had spoken with
his rabbi, who suggested a ceremony that would address experience of Dad for
both good and ill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Make sure you're
burying the right person,&#8221; the rabbi advised.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While I already felt a need not to be hypocritical in whatever I said, I
was uneasy about structuring the ceremony according to a particular point of view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among other things, I pointed out that if
the rabbi did this at a funeral, he could be a detached leader whom people
could trust to guide events, whereas we had no one in the family to play that
role.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">There was a brief period during the planning when Mother
thought she would like a rabbi, and David offered to try to find someone; but
for whatever reasons, Mother changed her mind.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The ceremony would be the improvisation of those in attendance.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I told David that I felt he didn&#8217;t need to agonize over what
was or wasn&#8217;t appropriate to say&#8212;that he should trust his instincts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was easier to give him that advice than
to take it myself.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In any event, Mother knew that the ceremony would not be a
simple eulogy or collection of eulogies.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And she composed a magnificent statement of her own&#8212;she said she wrote
it only the night before the ceremony&#8212;that while loving and intense overall it
nonetheless included some criticism of Dad.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I felt she was doing this to make it easier for David and me, and indeed
she said something like that when we discussed it later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This concern was not atypical of her; there
were other moments I remember when she went out of her way to ease a difficult
way for her children, and I intend to mention them elsewhere. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Since Mom sent me a copy of her statement, I&#8217;m going to
include it here:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Attendees at the memorial ceremony were all Dad&#8217;s children
and their spousal figures, Sammy, Rebecca and Larry and their two children,
Jason and Annie, Sol and his partner, Richard, Heidi and Marty, Jane (Annie&#8217;s
mother) and her partner Paul, Laura (Maxine&#8217;s elder daughter; Karen, the
younger, wanted to attend but was recovering from foot surgery) and her
husband, Anthony; and by telephone Mimi and Iris.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We also had some statements that we read from other family
members and friends; they should all be on the CDs that Jason is preparing.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The ceremony lasted nearly two hours and worked well, in the
best (as opposed to whatever the worst might have been) Yanowitz family
tradition of doing something original and getting it right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Heidi wrote me that she actually appreciated
the franker statements about her Grandfather because it helped her see him with
some sense of reality, and Laura told me that it helped her because she was
concerned about how to approach issues with her own father, with whom she has a
checkered history.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">At home that evening I told Maxine that while I had said
things I meant (I deliberately had not written anything down other than a few
notes, though I had been thinking since the day of Dad&#8217;s death about what I
would say), and while I had said been honest, I felt that something was
missing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn&#8217;t know what it was,
what I might have said differently.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The next day a small group met at Van Cortlandt Park: Mom,
the children and our significant others, and David&#8217;s friends Bruce and
Ellen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it turned out, for me it was
good that this was a small and separate ceremony, and that I didn&#8217;t miss out on
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alan reconnoitered and found the
lake that was probably what Dad described in his memoirs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We met at a Burger King, drove to the lake,
parked and walked a short distance through the snow, probably at least a foot
deep, to a metal bridge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Causing Judi
considerable unease, Alan crept down to the water to crack the ice so that
moving water could take the ashes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>First he used a gardening trowel, then he came up, borrowed Mom&#8217;s cane,
and returned to the ice to break it with the cane.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This interaction, too, was utterly typical: Alan doing a good
deed but ignoring any disquiet caused by the way he did it, Judi fruitlessly
protesting.</p>

<p class="stblcolhdr"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">December 31, 2003</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We all stood on the bridge above the ice Alan had
cracked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dad&#8217;s ashes had arrived in a
small, heavy cardboard box, perhaps 9 inches on a side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With help from a knife Alan provided, I
opened the box, nervous about exactly what was inside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It turned out to be a silvery can with a
removable top.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gingerly we pulled the
top off: inside was a thick, transparent plastic bag.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cut the bag open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
ashes were densely packed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is hard
to believe that a full human being can be condensed down to the contents of
that can.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Judi had brought kitchen scoops.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First Mother scooped some ashes, dropped them into the water, and
tearfully said something like, &#8220;Good-by, darling.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then Judi used the scoop to spread some ashes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m not sure if she said anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>David reached in with his hand, grabbed some
ashes, scattered them and said something.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I hadn&#8217;t wanted to touch the ashes (I had read on the web to expect
small bone fragments, an idea that I found disgusting, though in fact I could
see none), but watching David made me feel it was a good idea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Several times I dug my fingers into the
dense material, resembling chalk in its look and firmness, to scrape away
dollops of dust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I had a
reasonable handful, I dropped it in the water.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I felt as though I should say something, but nothing seemed right, and
so I stayed silent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can&#8217;t remember if
anyone else spread ashes after that.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It was probably at this point that David recited the
Kaddish, as he had done the day before at the memorial ceremony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It meant nothing to me either time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But now I took the time to look around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The day was cold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The park was filled with snow and the water was largely ice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A couple of people were visible in the
parking lot 30 yards away, but otherwise no one else but us mourners was
present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other than the background
sound of David&#8217;s Kaddish, intense serenity and quiet surrounded us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tried to imagine Dad as a boy of maybe 12,
in the Depression, coming here in spring or summer to soak up the utter sense
of peace I was feeling in the same place this wintry day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He writes about how his visits to the park
brought him to, or maybe grew from, love for nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I was seeing an innocent, oppressed boy seeking sanctuary
from the poverty and emotional misery of daily life on the Lower East
Side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">These thoughts continued when David finished and others
began conversing&#8212;the kind of conversation that emerges after intense emotion
has played out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wanted to stare at
the ashes in the water&#8212;most of them had been spilled in a large lump after we
all had finished our turns, and they were partly hidden by the steel girder
that formed the side of the bridge, maybe two and a half feet high.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have a great fear of heights, and although
we weren&#8217;t more than 10 feet above the water, probably by instinct I leaned
forward to prop myself angst the girder and be able to look down without
fearing that I would fall in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I learned
later that others who watched me, especially Judi, were fearful I was going to
fall in, or maybe even jump in.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I in
fact felt quite secure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">After several seconds I started crying, spasmodic sobbing
that forced its way out of me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt
self-conscious, assumed people were watching, but worked to let myself feel and
do whatever my body wanted.</p>

<p class="stblcolhdr"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">January 6, 2004 (resumed)</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I let the crying come.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Two hands touched my back; I realized later it was Judi and Mom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I kept looking at the ashes and around the
park.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I mumbled half-sentences like,
&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t?&#8230;&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I started walking slowly
further across the bridge and through the snow into the park, paralleling the
lake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>50 yards later a scream tore out
of me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I heard Judi call out in
concern, but without turning around I waved my hand to indicate I was
okay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I continued plodding and muttering
half-sentences, then started looping away from the lake toward another, smaller
body of water and then back to the bridge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No one said anything as I passed and headed for the cars.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Maxine was with a couple of other people at the cars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I took her and started walking down a
snow-covered path.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For a moment she
hesitated, not wanting to walk in the snow, but I asked her to walk with me and
she did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few steps further Alan hurried
up and started to ask a practical question, maybe about dinner, but I waved him
off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We didn&#8217;t walk much further,
Maxine and I, but I did say that I thought maybe I should to stay in the City
that night; I had been thinking about this as I walked to the cars, but I felt
embarrassed to say it outright, especially after all the fuss I&#8217;d made about
wanting to get back to Connecticut.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
agreed it was a good idea.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">What I think happened was not that I mourned my father&#8217;s
death but the loss of a father-son relationship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt sorry for myself; I felt sorry for him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I imagined the boy Dad was with hopes and
fantasies about what kind of adult he would be, and I saw how much, in my eyes,
he had failed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mostly I was focusing on
his failure to me as a father&#8212;his inability to be patient, to watch me be
different from what he wanted, to love me regardless, together with the need to
hold me to standards that had helped him survive as a child and adult.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I saw the deprived child he was and the
deprived child I felt I was&#8212;I speak about emotional deprivation here, though
scarce money certainly exacerbated both our situations.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">For some decades, since realizing how angry I was at the way
my father treated me as a child, I had felt that to find peace I would have to
forgive him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But maybe not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On that day I didn&#8217;t forgive me, but I did
get past the rage, or at least anger, that I always nurtured if any sympathy
for him ever started to rear up in me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His abuse was too momentous and horrible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Oh, I had often been pleasant with him when I was an adult, even
sometimes admired something he did. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>But
I could never let him, and more importantly myself, I was now realizing, off
the hook.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, without consciously
forgiving him, I was letting the rage recede, replaced by a deep sadness of
what he had never had, what I had never had, and what we had never had
together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These thoughts have been
often on my mind in the weeks since that Sunday.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">So instead of having Maxine hurry me to a train station
where I could catch the next New Haven train, I (and Maxine) joined the others
to go to a Chinese restaurant for a late lunch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mom treated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Chinese food
was what Dad and Mom had always taken us for when Judi, David and I were
children and we had anything to celebrate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The mood during the meal was fairly light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We talked about ordering an honorary dish of shrimps and lobster
sauce, Dad&#8217;s favorite, or of setting an Elijah-like plate for him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Although I did talk that evening with Maxine about how I was
feeling, what was most important to me, intensely reassuring, was just knowing
she was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although we had been
living together 8 ½ years, I was still surprised at how emotionally dependent
on her I had become.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I don&#8217;t say that
disapprovingly; I know it&#8217;s a good thing in the right proportions; but it&#8217;s
always a little surprising and perhaps a little unsettling to re-discover.)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Before leaving for the train the next morning, I made a
series of phone calls to find out if the car was still in the lot in Milford,
Connecticut, and how snowed in it was.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was eventually told yes to the first and a lot to the second.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During my various phone calls to Milford I
asked if anyone knew a person who would shovel out the car for a price, but no
one did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I joined Maxine to help get
Karen, on crutches because of a foot operation, to her doctor across town, and
en route I bought a snow shovel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Eventually I took the train to Milford, found that the car could
actually be driven forward with no shoveling, and returned to Madison without
incident.</p>

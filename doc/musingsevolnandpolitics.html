<p class="MsoNormal">The notion of biological evolution as a steady movement from
low to high extended itself to the movement of history&#8212;or ran in parallel with
that notion, since we find Hegel and Marx both seeing history as a movement
towards some high(est) end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Social
Darwinism shared a similar position: we should get out of the way of
survival-of-the-fittest to let it takes its objective, non-judgmental course to
steady improvement of the species.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Mendel and then analysis of DNA structure (along with
understanding of mutation) produced an understandable evolutionary mechanism,
with the necessary addition that survival of the fittest refers to
propagation of genes into offspring that will live to sexual adulthood and
themselves propagate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the genetic
understanding did not intrinsically require that evolution be viewed as a
progress from low to high, the evaluation continued that evolving from
one-celled animals to humankind represented a movement from low to high.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No less was there a sense of social
evolution: with every generation society was getting better and better&#8212;despite
lack of universal agreement about the exact meaning of &#8220;better&#8221; and a
&#8220;perfection&#8221; toward which social or biological evolution was supposedly
moving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Within the Western &#8220;liberal&#8221;
tradition, the Idea of Progress, however, seemed a naturally inevitable
concomitant of what became to all but religious conservatives the patent truth
of some kind of evolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Faith
generally increased that science would provide elixirs to solve vexing,
insistent life problems like supplying energy, reducing onerous (as opposed to
enjoyable) human labor, dazzling us with gimmickry that would entertain and
serve us, providing greater leisure time for greater individual creativity or
just gratification.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The exact way evolution works ran into controversy&#8212;e.g.,
steady, slow adaptation or punctuated equilibrium.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But these differences reflected interesting reflection on
alternative procedures, not fundamental questioning of a general truth of
biological evolution.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal">Sociobiology, an approach of recent decades, seemed to me a
fruitful way of considering parallels in cultural evolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the grounds (or fear) that this approach
encouraged a determinism about social roles that harked back to notions that we
all belong where we are in life, the left mostly distrusted this approach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it never seemed to me that this was a
necessary consequence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary,
I felt that if we could identify ways in which culture evolved (not in any
inevitable sequence, but as a result of accident and experimentation) we could
address ways to undermine cultural forces that seem unfair and better anticipate consequences of social
engineering while constructing
useful alternatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I still feel this, but the
issue no longer feels so important, perhaps because such a &#8220;science&#8221; would in
fact be so incapable of certainty.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In the West, somewhere in the 1970s, the idea of progress, or
the conviction of its inevitability&#8212;and exactly what it meant anyway&#8212;ceased
being a given.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Causes
likely included a
failing economy, increased awareness of ecological destruction our
technology
was producing, the increased rate of cancer that must at least in part
reflect
the steadily increasing amounts and expanding kinds of chemicals to
which our
bodies had never had a chance to adapt or, if somewhat adapted, had
become present at&nbsp;levels too high for that adaptation to help us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Genocide as a tool of civilization, which we wanted to believe
had to have ended with the defeat and exposure of Nazism in particular and
fascism in general, crept back into our vision&#8212;in Cambodia, Rwanda, the
Balkans.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Especially starting with the Reagan administration, reversals&nbsp;grew steadily
of liberal&#8212;not
radical&#8212;agendas that we thought were entrenched, and leftish political activity
increasingly had to focus on holding the line on (and trying to reinstate) social
and legal values we had once fought hard to institute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">What in the West during the 60s and early 70s (and despite
the election of Richard Nixon) had seemed to some of us like heady times
presaging permanent radical change evolved into a cultural environment encouraging us to
doubt the long-term effects of what we considered meaningful social
change.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The degree to which people
voted their pocketbooks (or their conceptions of what affected their
pocketbooks) without regard to well-being beyond themselves became more
and more dismaying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Politicians who
supposedly were heirs to at least liberal views and often more progressive
ones&#8212;Mitterand, Blair, Schroeder, Clinton&#8212;grabbed for the middle at best,
developed &#8220;realistic&#8221; policies that sought to pre-empt rightward policies by
instituting policies a bit less right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">For all I know, such courses are inevitable, that when
people get into power they face, or come to believe they're facing, political
conditions that simply won&#8217;t permit the luxury of prettier ideological
stances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We can see such a phenomenon
on the right, too, certainly, as with &#8220;moderate&#8221; stances war-criminal Ariel Sharon felt
compelled to take, albeit kicking and screaming, to fend off
formerly familiar allies.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The distinction would be between being in power or out of
power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Al Gore, a political figure I
never liked from when I knew about him in the mid-80s&#8212;he seemed glib, narrow in
his thinking, seeking to say only what he thought would be popular&#8212;came into
his own only after &#8220;losing&#8221; the 2000 presidential election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I suspect had he won he would have been
Clintontonian in general, though perhaps a stronger supporter of environmental
causes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although his being out of power
allowed the Bush administration to run roughshod over the economy, civil
liberties and international &#8220;diplomacy,&#8221; it did seem to give Gore a voice at
last.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Though with some flaws, on the
whole I find his film, <i>An Inconvenient Truth</i>, an enormous success in
rendering complex ecological and environmental history issues
understandable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I suspect that film has
done more to legitimize environmentalism as a vital social concern than any
other single activity or person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just
as the Soviet Union never looked so good as in the time since its demise, Gore
has never looked so good as when he cannot have direct involvement in the
government.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Alongside deterioration of the ability to believe in
inevitable social progress were forces like postmodernism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently I was a premature postmodernist:
by the end of my undergraduate major in philosophy (1963), I had concluded what
I have held to this day--that &#8220;objectivity&#8221; in any traditional meaning of the
term is impossible, and that all ideas and observations, including those of
science, are filtered through the individual brain, which no matter the effort
cannot avoid some preconceptions that bias the results.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Radical skepticism is unavoidable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a modernized version of Kant&#8217;s
formulation of inbred categories that keep us from seeing any
things-in-themselves or Plato's allegory of the cave.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">As I used to say to my students, however, the principle that
everyone has a right to his or her own opinion does not mean that all opinions
are equally right; we can still build standards that reduce, even minimize, our
inherent subjectivity so that we can in fact fairly well share knowledge and
its implications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My own bias is
towards a naïve realism that says most of our empirical observations are close
to accurate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Most&#8221; (perhaps &#8220;many&#8221;
would be apter) is crucial: we need always be on guard that a given moment is
not one of those times when our senses are deluding us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also suggest that personal honesty, the
effort to be as aware as possible of our own subjectivity, is crucial to communicating
more than solipsistic (or narcissistic) ideas.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Inevitable as subjectivity is, we are nonetheless part of a world that
consists of seemingly endless other subjectivities, and somehow we do find ways
to ameliorate the theoretical alienation that should result.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Viewed in one way (a way I&#8217;d like to encourage), acceptance
of the impossibility of &#8220;objectivity&#8221; should produce some humility (though it
can also produce arrogance) to soften the edges of human beings&#8217; separateness
from one another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can make us more
receptive to other points of view, more patient in working out our own ideas
and understandings, more collaborative with spousal figures, children, friends,
organizations, even enemies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it can
run afoul of arrogance, so recognition of subjectivity can make us too
malleable, too accepting of conditions (I think especially of injustice) on the
grounds that no one can say for sure what is right and wrong.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I can offer no hard-and-fast rule for not falling victim to
the perils of misunderstanding the limitations on our judgments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like any other principle we wish to affirm
in life, it is ultimately insusceptible of rational demonstration or
control.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All reasoning starts with a
priori principles; only if others accept a particular set do we have much chance
of communicating.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An obvious example:
debating religion gets nowhere unless the debaters share some basic religious
attitude&#8212;usually, belief (or disbelief) in a deity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those of us who have supported civil disobedience have certainly
attempted to persuade others of our rightness; but there is really nothing
obvious or inevitable about our reasoning, any more than there is about the
reasoning of those who would sit in at abortion centers (or gun down
abortionists on the grounds of doing god&#8217;s work).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Of course, people try to get around this problem by finding <i>some</i>
common assumption on which to build an (often tenuous) argument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the worst cases, this happens by appeal
to people&#8217; worst instincts or reflexes, as commonly occurs when national
leaders seek support for war-making or other destructive policies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After 9/11, at least for awhile, there was
no holding back the upswell of militarism in supposed defense of personal
security against the new satanic force, terrorism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Warning voices (which proved accurate) beseeching people to
consider the longer term effects on Muslims around the world (notice that this
appeal uses the same assumption as the war-mongers&#8212;that we all want to feel
secure) were condemned as sell-outs, cowards, bleeding hearts, traitors (fill
in your own favorite <i>ad hominem</i> label). <span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">What I am saying here is largely not new to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is new is the attempt to explain
specifics, at least in the US, about the discouraging nature of the last few
decades for ongoing, meaningful social change in the service of social justice.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;" class="MsoNormal">The following is a slightly edited version of an e-mail I sent my
mother on May 29, 2007, when I felt I had made a&nbsp;breakthrough in my
psychotherapy in relation to my relationship with and anger towards my father
(who died in 2003).<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the umpteenth
time over 35 years of therapy, I&#8217;d been revisiting that history, and recently I had been re-reading
<a href="mea%20culpa%20my%20intro.html">his memoirs</a>&nbsp;with a new eye.</p>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">



<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">I have always felt that Dad wanted me to redeem his own life
by how I lived mine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think that his
lifelong <a href="meaculpa5.html#dadmotherdeath">guilt that he killed his mother</a> (as I discussed with you when I first
read the memoirs, and you validated), probably combined with some kind of guilt
about the deaths of two brothers in the months before (and, I expect, the drama
of his sister, Sylvia, ending up in a sanatorium because her care at home was
overwhelming), and who knows what other imagined guilt before and after the
deaths, drove this need for redemption.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Whenever I talk about all this now, I get tears in my eyes&#8212;frustration
and anger <span style="font-style: italic;">for</span> Dad because he didn&#8217;t deserve this, should not have had his life
driven by these events.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t forget
the abusive, unjustifiable consequences to me, but now they don&#8217;t haunt
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a right to be angry, maybe
for a long time, but I spent far too many years at it.) <span style="">&nbsp;</span>As I re-read his memoirs, I see, for example,
that he refers a number of times to &#8220;hurting&#8221; his mother, as in anecdotes about
how he brought fauna home from Van Cortlandt Park.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deprivation of tenement poverty all around him in his
childhood comes through especially starkly to me on this reading.</p><p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">

<span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">I
always felt that Dad wanted me to be an MD, and I remember how touchy he was about
my childhood fantasies of what I&#8217;d be when I grew up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I vividly remember, for example, how he blew up when I, about 13,
said at the dinner table that I wanted to become a baseball announcer.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">I don&#8217;t, however, have a memory that Dad nagged or
extensively lobbied me about what he wanted me to be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I wonder if I didn&#8217;t pick up from him (from you, too?) a
sense of what I <span style="font-style: italic;">shouldn't</span> become, what wasn&#8217;t good enough for me, which ended
up leaving few options.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;ve never
regretted the option I took by getting a Ph.D. (though I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t put
it to better use), but while he expressed pride at my having done so, I always
felt he was disappointed that I wasn&#8217;t a &#8220;real&#8221; doctor.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Then in a therapy session a few weeks back, reflecting on
Dad&#8217;s giving me Paul de Kruif&#8217;s&nbsp;<i><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">Microbe
Hunters</span></i><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"> </span> (in my teens, I think), I had
one of those therapeutic flashes that come every once in awhile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had always thought the book was to
encourage me to be an MD; but I suddenly realized that it wasn&#8217;t specifically
about the great work of doctors but about dramatic, largely life-saving
innovations in medical care.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I think Dad needed me to do something that involved saving
people, that ideally I would have a medical career that enabled me to discover
how to save numerous lives, and that by doing so I would somehow make up for
his having been unable to save his family members (and that probably includes
Sylvia).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>[<i>Added March 21, 2008</i>:
This desire of his probably also had something to do with the kinds of
volunteering and political activity I&#8217;ve undertaken in my life.]</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I have always had the feeling that I must do something
important in life, that I should be &#8220;famous&#8221;&#8212;a misguided sense of what my
therapist, calls my &#8220;grandiosity&#8221;; and this sense has driven much of my feeling
of failure in my life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I <span style="font-style: italic;">have</span> felt key
successes in the most important areas of my life&#8212;raising my son largely on my own; getting a Ph.D.; and
forging a happy relationship with Maxine&#8212;and lesser satisfying achievements
like my acting (which I&#8217;m sure I would never have undertaken without Dad&#8217;s
example).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But something important has
felt lacking.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This concern has had a political dimension: I have often
felt despair over my inability to change the world, over unforgivable
injustices everywhere, everyday, that contrast starkly with my own (and
others&#8217;) fortunate position in life.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This frustration feels exactly parallel to how I experience Dad&#8217;s loss
of his mother and brothers when I read the memoirs.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I also think that, for many different reasons, a significant
number of people, probably a majority, have parallel issues to mine that cause
easy resentment and anger and self-doubt and&#8212; sometimes, especially for many
minorities, with justification&#8212;feelings of victimization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My need is not to set myself apart, or
continue as I&#8217;ve been just because others are in the same boat, but to gain
understanding that helps heal me, to make the most of whatever years I (and
Maxine) still have.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Of course, it doesn&#8217;t matter whether my &#8220;understanding&#8221; is
right but that, even if mistaken, it (so far) is having a profound healing
effect on me.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">As we were discussing these matters, my therapist (to
whom I&nbsp;read some of the memoirs) told me about a psychoanalytic theory
that traumas can be passed from one generation to another by silence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In my case, I take this to mean that what I
interpret as Dad&#8216;s guilts got passed on to me with little or no discussion,
that largely or wholly unconsciously he exuded them in a way that I
unconsciously internalized.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">(In this context, I should note that I have understood for
some time that much of what happened to me as a child has had a schizoid effect
on who I am: it left painful marks which I have struggled to heal as an adult,
but it also guided me in strengthening directions, like supportive sensitivity
to people and a radical political analysis of the world.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, and more obviously, I think
parents pass along <span style="font-style: italic;">positive</span> silent messages about how children should behave in
life.)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Mother&#8217;s Day weekend was a couple of days after the first
therapy session addressing these ideas.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That Saturday in Manhattan I suddenly starting noticing the high
frequency with which I feel affronted by others&#8217; behavior&#8212;how someone
mis-drives or mis-parks, how people get in my way on the sidewalk or cut ahead
of me at a subway turnstile, how petty injustices to me (and sometimes others)
proliferate around me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I realized I was
feeling bombarded almost every moment by one affront or another caused by some
other person&#8217;s not following &#8220;the rules&#8221; as I have them in my head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(They're not necessarily even bad rules, but
their quantity and <span style="color: black;">pervasiveness</span> are debilitating&#8212;and exhausting.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each time I started to get annoyed now, this
awareness led me to respond within several seconds by reminding myself that
here was another example of my need to transform the world (it also reflects
needs like always having to be right and my resentment at perceived
interference with my autonomy, but these are older truths and for the moment
less important).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No sooner, it seemed
that day, had I defused one affront than I experienced a new one, defused it,
and so on over and over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is, the
understanding did not stop the visceral reaction, but it was now giving me a
tool to <span style="font-style: italic;">manage</span> that reaction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I marveled at how I could have lived my life that
way&#8212;especially before I went on an anti-depressant, which greatly relieved that
sense of steady assault (which had mostly taken the form of a racing mind
constantly passing judgment on the world and myself).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet I also started to feel liberated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even though I couldn't stop the seemingly constant affronts, the
sense of control in response was&#8230;thrilling.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For the first time in many, many years I started to feel that I can
actually enjoy NY City (because I can manage what has made it so infuriating to
me).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This same dynamic, with much slower resolution, was
happening the next day when I got angry with the maitre d&#8217; at the Brooklyn restaurant
where we ate for Mother's Day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My behavior then, I
think, was exacerbated by being with family members (soon including Alan, who
shares this family trait) who reacted similarly, and by the unconscious feeling
that I had to take care of you and Judi (why, I don&#8217;t know exactly&#8212;but it
surely has origins in Dad&#8217;s messages, sometimes explicit but always prevalent,
that I should take care of you in particular and women in general).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I finally realized what I was doing, I
first stepped back; and then, when Alan, Judi, you and the maitre d&#8217; were all
talking at once, without thinking I shouted, &#8220;Everybody stop!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Somewhat to my wonder, everybody did.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Though superstitiously fearful that I will let
slip the benefit of these recent insights, in the days since then I
have continued to build on them, and if
anything the affronts, though still easy to feel, are less powerful,
and the
speed with which I defuse them gets faster.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Throughout this time I have been far more at peace, much less besieged
with (often amorphous) anxiety. &nbsp;[<span style="font-style: italic;">Added March 21, 2008</span>:
I have not (yet) lost those benefits, and am much better now than I was
last May--without needing to review the memories of what I learned.]</p>

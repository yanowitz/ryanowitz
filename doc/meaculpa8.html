<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
father's calculations were a day off.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We slept three nights on the road and arrived at our new home at about
noon Saturday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It felt like I was going
back to an earlier period in my life; my bed was an army cot in the kitchen
again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mink had a little room for
herself and my father and Jean had a nice-sized bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't mind too much, except on the first
night I was eaten up by bedbugs and had to spend half a day getting rid of
them, with boiling water where it was feasible, and Black Flag in the rest of
the crevices.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
realized something was different about my father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He'd looked powerful when I met him at the cemetery, and now I
noticed his chest had slipped somewhat.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I guess he decided to forgo the torture of constricting himself in a
corset. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>It changed his appearance, but
he didn't look fat so much as big.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
guess I aggravated him because of my taciturnity, and one day when we were
alone in the house, something must have really gotten to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't know what we were talking about, but
he suddenly turned to me, bit his lips, and then said smilingly, "What's
the matter?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You wanna fight me?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Come on."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
leaped at the chance; I leaped at him, also, and never came near him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He kept his hands open and didn't touch me,
except to ward me off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I dived, I
jumped, and I was stonewalled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he
got tired of playing and grabbed my arms in a vise-like grip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had giant hands and they held me
helpless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"That's enough," he
said.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His voice was shaky and his eyes
were moist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Yes, that's
enough."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I was
disappointed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd just wanted one crack
at him for my mother&#8211;maybe for myself&#8211;maybe because I felt guilty because I
didn't feel guilty enough.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Somehow I'd
failed and I wasn't sorry enough for the failure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt like I imagine a girl might feel who wanted and yet didn't
want to be held.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a very
uncomfortable feeling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't take
it; I turned and left the room.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0.5in;" align="center">*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Mink
and I accepted the dishwashing chores after dinner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd wash and she'd dry.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We'd actually look forward to the chore because we'd sing every song we
knew at the top of our lungs, and it was fun.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Jean was a bit of a bug about health; no reheated coffee, potatoes in
their skins, vegetables in their juices, no fried foods, but my father'd go off
on a hot dog binge on the sly and she'd find out and scold him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had a favorite Roumanian dish that they
called Kehnartzlech.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were just broiled
fat cigar-shaped hamburgers, and they were very tasty.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Sometimes
my father would talk about his homeland.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He'd tell Mink and me "When I was five years old I used to teach
eight, nine, ten-year-olds Hebrew lessons."<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He'd tell us "I'd make a meal out of piece of herring, a
slice of onion, and a piece of black bread."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told us that the name Yanowitz had originated as Yoineh-Yoineh
and an immigration clerk in the U.S. had changed it.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
father's business sense was poor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
never did understand how Jean let him rent a gift shop far from the center of
the town.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I guess they figured the low
rent made up for the location.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
didn't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was very boring for me to
sit around all day among the bric-a-brac imported from Czechoslovakia and
France and England and, of course, Japan, and wait on two or three customers a
day.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">One
day when my father was in the store, a dentist who had his office nearby
suggested that perhaps, instead of money exchanging hands between them, goods
could be exchanged for services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
guess my father figured he'd get something, at least, and arranged for me to get
my teeth examined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dentist found
few cavities, but he warned my father (who had a set of false teeth) that I
would lose mine unless my gums were seen to immediately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So he decorated his office and I sat and had
what he told me were diseased parts of my gums cut away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It didn't hurt much since he used novocaine,
but I felt the slice of the scalpel, and it felt very odd to spit severed parts
of myself down the dental drain.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
made a few friends while clerking.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was a girl who came in to admire some of our wares, and I got to
talking with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She noticed I was
writing in a notebook and became curious about what I was doing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was trying to write a poem.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd become interested in writing in my
never-finished senior year in Seward Park High School.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a good English teacher there, who had
invited me to come to his home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He'd
been impressed by the way I handled a class assignment in which he'd asked us
to use the title of a poem we read&#8211;"These Things I Love"&#8211;and write
about the things we loved in free verse.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I got caught up in the theme and described sights and sounds and smells
in nature, the bindings and musty odors of old books, and other special
loves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maybe he saw promise in me or
maybe it was a prelude to a <i>Catcher in the Rye</i> incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was during the terrible part of my
life, so I had quit school before taking advantage of his invitation.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
girl became very enthusiastic and said she wrote poetry also.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before I realized it, I had accepted an
invitation to come to her house that evening.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">She
introduced me to her parents and we had tea together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then she brought out her composition books and read some of her
poetry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a sort of weepy
character to her themes; and when we talked, I discovered she had some kind of
illness that was going to shorten her life.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I felt sad for her and spoke gently, but she acted bravely about it, and
the conversation turned, as conversations do, to religion and her Christian
faith, and I told her I was Jewish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
was very tolerant about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She noticed
the clock, said it was late, and bade me good night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She never dropped around at the gift shop again.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">A
young fellow about my age started hanging around the shop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He noticed I was reading Dickens, and he
started a literary conversation at first, and then started talking about his
interest, architecture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His name was
John, and he told me Memphis was a gold mine for varieties of architecture, and
suggested we take a walk through town that evening and he would point out some
of the different styles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was okay
with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the walk I noticed the
buildings he showed me were different, but I couldn't keep track of the period
names.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was like a walk through a
museum where the artists are unfamiliar and their names are forgotten almost
immediately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was entertaining, and I
thanked him for his instruction and went home.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Two
days later he showed up and asked me if I wanted to learn some more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had nothing else to do so I said
okay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After we walked for a while, we
sat down on some steps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>John started
talking about Hollywood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He'd been out
there and had met some of the stars and been invited to some of the parties,
which he confided were really orgies, a word that had all kinds of exotic
connotations to me, but with which I was unfamiliar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've always been interested in the occult, science fiction,
arcane knowledge in general, and, of course, sex.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I pumped him.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">He
told me that there were many homosexuals there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was another mysterious word.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd had experiences with people who touched my sacred organ
surreptitiously in movie houses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd
once had a well-dressed man lure me into the hallway of a building and offer me
a dollar to do an errand for him, but he also attempted a private touch, which
I evaded and hurriedly exited the hallway.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I'd met Oskie and Izzy Rosenblatt, but couldn't understand what their
lewdness was about.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I liked girls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt a little guilty about the way I liked
girls, but I didn't want to be treated like one, or treat a boy like one.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">John
told me about his experience with Tyrone Power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a shock to find a masculine hero of mine indulging in what
seemed to me revolting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>John said that
he'd enjoyed it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I retched a bit and we
continued walking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a summery
evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A car stopped with four young
fellows in it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was some word
byplay that passed over my head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
driver's companion had his head in the driver's lap.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>John quickly drew me away from them.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
stopped for coffee in a cafe that had a number of young fellows in it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A couple joined us and started talking the
talk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They called themselves
"promoters."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It gradually
dawned on me that they were on the lookout for men with money who would pay
them for their sexual favors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
bragged about their sales techniques, how they tracked lucrative clients, and I
began to wonder who was normal in Memphis, they or I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was smart enough to only ask leading questions that I hoped
weren't too naive, but they took me as one of theirs who was new to the city
and told me where the pickings were best.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One fellow told a story of how he'd allowed himself to be picked up in a
hotel lobby and had been paid fifty bucks by his seducer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I finally got away and expressed my
amazement to John, and he nodded understandingly.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">He
stopped in again the next day and we talked books for a while.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he became playful and laughingly
pinched my nipple.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't take it as
a joke.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"You
do that again, and I'm gonna bust yuh in the mouth."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"What's
a matter?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Felt good, didn't it?"</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Why
don't you get the hell out of here?"</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"All
right, forget about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I won't touch
your titty again."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He smiled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Unless you ask me."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
spat out, "Ask you! I'll be damned if I ever ask you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just get the hell out of here and never come
back!"</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">He
shook his head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"You never can
tell, but I understand," he said commiseratingly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"I felt the same way once, but
now!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You'll be sorry."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Get
out of here, or you'll be sorry right now."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I took a step towards him.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"You're
never gonna be sure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'll stop by; give
you another chance."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
watched him walk out of the store with some mixed emotions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wanted friends, but not at a price like
that!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wondered if it was possible
that I could become like him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knew
that I had feelings that had come on me that were not what I expected and that
I couldn't necessarily fight off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
prayed that this wasn't in my future.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0.5in;" align="center">*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
shared the house with a woman of about forty and her sixteen-year-old
daughter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've forgotten their names;
I'll call them Mrs. (pronounced long before women's lib as Miz) Baylor, and
Maybelle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Miz Baylor was a believer in
the power of prognostication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She'd sit
in front of her cards (We shared a large parlor) and tell fortunes that she
hoped would come true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After watching
her a few times, I asked her to let me try.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I made up things out of whole cloth, and the poor woman was so eager for
good things to happen that she believed everything I predicted.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Oh,
you are so very good at this," she said.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"You
know I can't promise."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"That
is quite all right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know exactly how
it is.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes they just don't fall
right."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She called to her
daughter, "Maybelle, you just come down hyah and let Edward tell your
fortune.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He's real good."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Maybelle
was, beyond a doubt, the prettiest girl I had ever seen, let alone, met.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't know what stopped me from falling
madly in love with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think if
she'd crooked a finger, I would have been over the precipice head-over-heels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a rare pleasure to look at her, and
to talk to her,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and to listen to
her&#8211;she was a thing of beauty!</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
told her fortune.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She cut the cards; I
divided them into six piles, took off the top card and the bottom card of
alternate piles, shuffled them, laid them out in three piles of four cards each
face down and proceeded to draw cards at random from each pile one at a time.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I'd
flip the card over on its face, place my right hand over it, then my left hand,
then pick it up in both hands and hold it to my forehead and relay its meaning
in slow, ponderous terms.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"The
Four of Spades is a lucky card and will counter the effect of any unlucky card
among the ones you have chosen."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"The
Jack of Hearts is a dream-lover who awaits you in the wings of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is especially fortunate that he comes
after the Four of Spades since that determines a long and happy life for the
two of you with at least two children."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Each
card would bring good fortune unless I wanted to make things suspenseful, and I
could scare Maybelle and her mother, but I'd save them eventually by making
some card the Messenger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This mystic
figure always fixed things up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
prognostications were never questioned, I guess, because the girl and woman
were afraid to upset the qualities they believed resided in the cards.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
don't think Maybelle was as innocent as she made me believe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was like a fairy princess, and when I
sat next to her on the double swing on the porch, I would put my arm on the
cushion behind her; but I'd never "accidentally" let it slide over
her shoulders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was backward, I guess,
and I had a hell of a moral sense&#8211;after all, she was two years younger than
I&#8211;that was always a pain-in-the-neck justification for non-action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have a sneaking suspicion that she was
disappointed in me, but I put that down to braggadocio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She started having dates and waited for them
on the porch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would join her on the
swing and we'd chat till they came.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She'd introduce me and wave goodbye.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was lucky I wasn't in love with her because I'm sure that would have
made me miserable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It makes me
miserable to think about it today.</p>

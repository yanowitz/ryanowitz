<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Early morning you are free to explore around Monteverde
on your own or join us for a final bird watching hike. Afterwards, we&#8217;ll head
down the mountain in time to reach the bridge at Rio Tarcoles, where giant
crocodiles bask in the sun. Then down the road a bit we&#8217;ll spend the rest of
the day at Carara Biological Preserve, in time for a short hike and to view the
evening scarlet macaw migration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An
old-growth forest of striking complexity and density, Carara&#8217;s giant trees
include 10 of the rarest hardwoods in Costa Rica. The unique combination of 5
different ecosystems converge to provide habitat for many rare and endangered
animals, including one of the largest populations of scarlet macaws in the
country, which migrate daily from the inland rainforest to the coastal mangrove
swamps. This is also a great place to see white-faced capuchin monkeys and
spider monkeys. <o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>This afternoon, people who are on the 9-day tour will be
taken back to Alajuela (and to the airport the next morning.) The rest of the
group will continue south along the Pacific coast to the town of Quepas, gateway
to Manuel Antonio National Park, for a late arrival at our lodge, Villa Teca.</i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Up about 5:45.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
tote our luggage ourselves down the long path to the office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Buffet breakfast with no appealing choice;
for the second time on the trip I have granola.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We do lots of driving on badly graded dirt roads, then
arrive at a paved road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are on the
Pacific side of the country and we are zipping along in the general direction
of Panama.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Around 10 we pass a cemetery
with elaborate tombs and tombstones and a tree with yellow leaves that Koky
identifies; about 11 we have a rest stop in a small town that includes a large
soccer field with a school beyond it.</p><p class="MsoNormal">About 12:30 we stop at one end of a bridge across a river
and walk across while the bus goes to meet us on the other side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Below us is a considerable dry riverbed with
a remnant of the river and a dozen or two crocodiles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(One or more iguanas are in trees on the near side of the
riverbed.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each side of the bridge,
which at its midpoint is probably 30-40 feet above the river, has a one-person
wide sidewalk and railing that is just under waist-high, and we cross the road
back and forth between the two sides.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the 2<sup>nd</sup> part of the bridge the railing is missing and only
a knee-high concrete barrier retains pedestrians.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I imagine falling over, somehow surviving the fall but not being
sure how to escape the crocodiles which, for the moment lying still or moving
lethargically, would suddenly rush to chomp me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m nervous with the height, but I keep going.</p><p class="stblpara">We have lunch en route at a busy, large, open-air seaside
restaurant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>E, A, G and now S again
order an extravagant shared meal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
have a tasty shrimp dish; I&#8217;m beginning to feel better than indifferent to
shrimp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I ignore the beet salad and
most of the veggies on my plate.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="stblpara">We continue on the road.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At 2:30 we visit a 2-part national park for two hours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before we enter the forest itself, we take
some photos, and A seems accidentally to delete her camera card; I explain to
her that if she wants the photos she should not take new ones because the
existing ones can be undeleted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
takes awhile to grasp this, and others seem not to think I know what I&#8217;m
talking about.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A gives me her camera
card in case I can retrieve the photos when we get home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>



<p class="stblpara">We enter the forest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Part 1 is secondary growth; when we cross a brook/narrow river after
maybe an hour we are in part 2, a primary, wet forest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I try to see the difference between this and
other primary forests we have seen, but I don&#8217;t succeed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We see little new or special.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s very hot and muggy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We walk two kilometers, and though I don&#8217;t
find it too draining I am, by the second half of the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>hike, eager to be done.</p><p class="stblpara">We drive on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Around
5:15 we wait our turn to cross a short bridge with one lane.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>15 minutes later we pass a carnival.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sunset is 20 minutes after that.</p>

<p class="stblpara">We drive to Quepos, where we stop at dusk to wander
about.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A finds a computer shop that
says it will undelete the photos ($10) and burn a CD ($4) with them by tomorrow
morning, so she takes the card from me; she is ecstatic and gives me a big
hug.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She insists she will buy me a
drink as a reward, but I say no; I never like to feel I&#8217;m profiting from doing
a favor or sharing knowledge.</p>

<p class="stblpara">All except Maxine and me are seeking activities for the next day,
a &#8220;free&#8221; day (i.e., Josh booked nothing for the group).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="stblpara">We go to a couple of different places.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>G, E, M and A all decide to rent ATVs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am startled at this: all seem to have
reasonable consciousness about ecological matters, and so I would have expected
them to eschew such damaging activity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In front of S I mention something about how polluting these are.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She &#8220;corrects&#8221; me: they also tear up the
landscape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I say that I intended that
as part of &#8220;polluting&#8221;; in fact, when I said &#8220;polluting&#8221; I thought, &#8220;I should
also mention tearing up the landscape,&#8221; but I decided I&#8217;d been enough of a
Jeremiah.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So while I had it in mind, I
didn&#8217;t really mean it to be part of &#8220;polluting.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="stblpara">This is not the first time (nor will it be the last) that S
has corrected me when I&#8217;ve been inexact.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For example, on an earlier day, when most of the others had visited a
serpentarium and referred to the &#8220;fer de lance&#8221; snake, I had translated the
name as &#8220;iron lance,&#8221; and she pointed out that that would be &#8220;lance de
fer.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have been both surprised at my
own imprecision and nettled by S&#8217;s justified corrections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, after saying I meant to include tearing
up the landscape, I add that I believe she and I agree on much more than she
might think.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have the sense that this
takes her a bit aback.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the rest of
the trip she is both more approachable and zings me more with mock {?] insults.</p>

<p class="stblpara">From Quepos we drive 7 km. to the Villa Teca.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our room seems intolerable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we all arrive, there seems to be some
screw-up; Koky speaks in Spanish (or maybe Italian, the native language of the
owners) for some time before getting us assignments to the very few rooms still
available.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our room has bed lamps that
will not stay in place to focus on what we might read.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tell Koky, who gets the co-manager, who
looks and delicately adjusts one lamp until it balances in the right position;
I sense a smirk of satisfaction with the easy solution to these troublesome
tourists (Americans?).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lamp does
not move with a light touch, but when I push just a bit more it returns to its
original position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is very clear the
manager doesn&#8217;t give a shit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I get
pissed and complain (who knows if he could understand me?) and want to get him
back to fix the lamps properly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instead, Koky asks for my Swiss army knife and uses it to tighten
relevant screws on both lamps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am
pissed that he has to do so&#8212;and that he chooses to make nice to the management
by doing so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the last straw for
me in a series of places with poor maintenance and uncaring management.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ugly American indeed!</p>

<p class="stblpara">The air conditioning is very weak.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The co-manager and Koky encourage us to let it run awhile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am not convinced but do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Later I apologize to Koky for my impatience
and irritability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By now I am feeling
high maintenance for him, and I don&#8217;t like that but also can&#8217;t leave alone the
issues that are irritating me.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During
dinner I get up to check the room, and sure enough the AC is worthless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s a hot night and I&#8217;m already irritated;
the thought of uncomfortable sleeping infuriates me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The office has a powerful, remote-control air conditioner, and at
least one of our companions has gotten a room with a similar conditioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I go back to dinner, tell Koky the problem
and that after dinner I want to deal with it (though I&#8217;m nervous about
waiting); he looks frustrated, eats a tad more for a few seconds, and comes
back to the room with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He seems to
agree (though perhaps he is wondering why the spoiled American can&#8217;t adapt [as
I transcribe this, I think about my issue with the lousy AC on the Burgundy
barge and how the captain didn&#8217;t really want to fix it; he and another worker
did put in a great effort under what looked like dangerous conditions, but the
AC didn&#8217;t seem any better after that; I had the impression that cash flow was
not good for the owners and this was a low priority]), and we go to the office,
where a pleasant night manager tries to be helpful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only a couple of rooms are available, but one has the
remote-control AC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s at the bottom
of many steps while our current room is convenient and easy to get to, and we
have unpacked everything, but I decide the good night&#8217;s sleep (actually, two
nights) is worth the effort.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
frenetically throw all unpacked items into our various pieces of luggage while
Koky waits and then helps me carry stuff down to the new room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He carries the yellow duffel bag, for which
I&#8217;m grateful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the new room, with a
bit less freneticism mixed with the desire to to put everything where Maxine
would want it, I unpack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During this
whole process I am eager to get everything done myself so that the move is
transparent to her; and indeed, she is grateful when she gets to the new
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before long I discover that the
door lock is resistant to turning and that the bathroom sink has no hot water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I expect the hot water problem has been
there for a long time and will remain for a long time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At least the shower has hot water.</p>

<p class="stblpara">(Look at how much space and effort I put into describing
affronts like this throughout the trip.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is symptomatic of how angry and deceived I feel by Josh&#8217;s
re-assurance when we were asking him about the trip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How spoiled am I?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t
feel I need things as luxurious as Maxine enjoys, but clearly I wanted more
comfort on the trip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps if key
matters like the long drives and the exhausting heat and humidity had not been
so consuming, I would have taken lodging problems more in stride.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, they exacerbated a general feeling
of dissatisfaction and discomfort.)</p>



<p class="stblpara">Back at dinner I have some dessert I had asked Koky to order
for me while I unpacked; I could have done without it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maxine and I return to the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turn out the light about 11:15 and can&#8217;t
get to sleep for awhile, but I sleep all night without waking to pee.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><b>Feb 12, Sunday</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>We&#8217;ll hike Manuel Antonio&#8217;s delightful tropical trails
and relax on the best beaches in Costa Rica.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Most brochures of Costa Rica feature the famous beaches of this
park.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Miles of gorgeous beaches and rainforest
trails are perfect for a day of total relaxation. Manuel Antonio is also the
only place besides the Osa Peninsula, (our next stop) where you can catch a
glimpse of the rare and endangered squirrel monkey, as well as many other
animals. Dinner bathed in the pink-orange glow of one of Manuel Antonio&#8217;s
famous sunsets. Overnight at Villa Teca<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="stblpara">Up at 6:15. a bit tired.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We pack for the beach, give all our laundry to Koky (but forget the
clothes we arrived in) to take to a laundry.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Lousy breakfast buffet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
mention the stiff lock and lack of hot water in sink.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Who cares?</p>

<p class="stblpara">The ATV renters go their way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bus drops us at a lovely beach while others go to other
activities; Maxine and I have decided we don&#8217;t want to do any hiking
today.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Koky negotiates beach chair
rentals for us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The eager guy who
watches the place (I have no idea if he really has any official role) puts up
our beach umbrella.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we think we&#8217;re
asking him if it&#8217;s too close to the tide, he seems to be reassuring.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maxine and I take turns going in and out of
the water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While she is in, I compose a
Valentine&#8217;s poem; to keep with Valentine&#8217;s tradition (on our first V day I had
written her a poem, and ever since she has made it clear that she expects one
every year; this year she had told me that because we&#8217;d be away and because
we&#8217;d gotten married she didn&#8217;t expect one).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I scrawl it in one of my little notebooks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s not very good but will serve the purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I finish a draft during our stay at the beach.</p>

<p class="stblpara">I&#8217;m in a pretty good mood&#8212;apparently inactivity brightens me
up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do have to move umbrella and
chairs several times as the tide comes in; the guy who rented the chair
re-locates the umbrella most times, though once I get irritated because he is
devoting his attention to others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Along
the main road behind the beach are vending stalls and an enclave of buildings that
mostly serve the beach traffic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I walk
to the end and bring back a shrimp pizza along with a Pina Colada for Maxine;
through much of the trip she&#8217;s been talking about getting such a drink, and as
when I moved us last evening, I feel excited to be doing something I know
she&#8217;ll like.</p>


<p class="stblpara">When I go in the water I find it pleasant and warm; I don&#8217;t
do my usual number of taking forever to get wet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Around three we take a taxi to the hotel; before we get in I ask
the fare; Koky had said it should be $2-3; the cabbie says $4 but I have become
confused and say fine; when I realize during the ride what has happened I&#8217;m
mildly annoyed but try to&nbsp;forget about it.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="stblpara">At the Villa Teca we go in the pool, not too big but pleasant
and always over my head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stay near
the edge even though I know I can swim any distance needed to get to a
ladder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two or three squirrel monkeys
hang around the pool; one walks a couple of feet from me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I find something very cool about the
presence of these monkeys.</p>

<p class="stblpara">At five the bus take us to a nearby restaurant to watch the
sun set.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Koky calls it &#8220;happy hour&#8221;; he
himself, he has told us, is an alcoholic and I see him always rigorous about
checking whether alcohol is used in any food preparation he wants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have a mediocre banana daiquiri, and
Maxine tells me her Pina Colada is also only so-so (she thought the one at
lunch was especially good).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have a
rare steak (<i>lomo</i>) for our early dinner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It&#8217;s a bit tough.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is E&#8217;s
last meal with us; he will be leaving in the morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A has bought him a t-shirt, and when I find out I make sure
Maxine and I chip in on it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It says in
Spanish a couple of words that mean something like &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</p>

<p class="stblpara">We will be giving up the yellow duffel bag tomorrow, to be
taken ahead to the Canal Grande.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We think
this is because our plane from Porto Jimenez to San Jose will allow only 25
pounds, but we will find out that pretty much all our travel after we separate
from the bus tomorrow will require little luggage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We pack accordingly and will be taking only our backpacks and the
Hippocreek bag.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(We have found that we
have used pretty much everything we brought and that Josh&#8217;s list
recommended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We could have done without
our ponchos, our rain jackets&#8212;it really doesn&#8217;t matter if you get rained on,

shrill, &#8220;I&#8217;ll lay you Roberta to 1 you&#8217;re </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">wrong.&#8221;</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">&#8220;Roberta to 1?&#8221; this guy comes back in a
cross between a rasp and a </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">whisper like he has laryngitis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And though I am still gazing straight ahead,
I look </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">towards
the voices from the corner of my eyes, and I see this geezer and geezette </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">standing together,
each with a hand and elbow wrapped around the same pole, his above hers, and
because we are rumbling around a curve they have one leg arcing off the floor
like they&#8217;re ballet dancers looking in a mirror.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is wearing a tie-dyed T-shirt hanging out over jeans torn in
the knees, and she has on a white miniskirt, white sneakers like right out of
the store window, white gloves and a white blouse that looks fresh from the
cleaners on a day </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">when fifteen seconds waiting on the platform turns you into a soggy
sponge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I cannot decide whose hair,
hers or his, looks more like Einstein&#8217;s just before he passed on.</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">The woman turns up her nose and wrinkles
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Roberta to 1.&#8221;</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><font size="-1"><i><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">&#8220;You&#8217;re </span></i><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">Roberta&#8221; he rasps, and they stop
talking.</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0.95pt; background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">Well I am very
curious what this is all about, but of course I cannot ask the old </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">ditz or even look
right at her because then she will know I am listening, so I am happy when her
boyfriend or husband or whatever he is starts in again and asks, &#8220;Do you have </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">any idea what you&#8217;re
talking about?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He shakes his head a
couple of times and I see in his free hand some kind of microphone, only he&#8217;s
not holding it to his mouth but </span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">alongside his throat.</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">&#8220;I&#8217;m not talking about me Roberta, I&#8217;m
talking about the number Roberta,&#8221; snaps </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">the old babe while the two of them are
letting their raised legs settle to the floor</span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her elbow that is looped around the pole has a teensy white handbag
swinging against raspy&#8217;s ribs, and without ever looking down, </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">every time the purse
has just finished whacking him</span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;"> he slaps the spot </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">like he is hoping to nail a mosquito.</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 9.35pt; text-align: justify; background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">&#8220;Roberta
is no number,&#8221; he says in that tone Father Preis used to use when we&#8217;d say
something like &#8220;abominable&#8221; instead of &#8220;abdominal.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Though when you look back </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">on it at least old Prissy cared, which is
more than you can say for teachers today.</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">Anyway, the old broad comes right back and
snaps, &#8220;This is how much you know </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">or think you know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Roberta is too a number, and a very good number, since after all
it is </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">my
own name, too.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For a moment she waves
her free forefinger at the guy, but right away jams the glove on the top of her
purse like she has forgotten she is protecting a </span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">diamond necklace she just bought at Tiffany&#8217;s.</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0.5pt; background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">We are now pulling
into where I need to get off, but of course I want to know the </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">rest of the story,
although to tell the truth I am already wondering whether I am merely listening
to another nutty biddy on the streets only this one happens to send her blouses
out for cleaning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All around me there
is much pushing and shoving because this </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.15pt;">is not only my stop but a major changing
point and most of the passengers who </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">were sitting down are now standing and
jockeying to be the first one out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
doors </span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">open, and I stand up,
too, but I linger near the two chatterboxes.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0.5pt; background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">Now although she must
be talking to raspy, I swear the old dame is staring </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">straight at me even though
I am keeping my face at right angles to her like I couldn&#8217;t care </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">less if she exists,
and I worry that she is wondering why the hell I am not exiting after </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">standing up from a
perfectly good seat which is now occupied as are all the other seats in </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">sight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;In grade school,&#8221; she is saying, &#8220;we would
stand in two rows at the school </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">entrance waiting to go in and the teacher
would count us to make sure we were all there.&#8221;</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">With all those people trying to push by me I
am struggling to keep standing in one place while looking like I really want to
leave, and of course people on the platform aren&#8217;t waiting until the car
empties but are squeezing in the door already, so that between </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">the two gossips on
the pole and myself we are creating quite a bottleneck although I seem </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">to be the only one
of us who is noticing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I figure
it&#8217;s every man&#8212;or I guess I better say person these days&#8212;for himself so long as
the doors don&#8217;t close before I hear </span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">the end of the story.</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">All this time, the old bag just keeps
chattering away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;I could never keep
still,&#8221; </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">she
is saying, &#8220;and this teacher, Miss Felafel or something like that, she would
count </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">&#8216;One,
two&#8217; and see me fidgeting and say, &#8216;Roberta control yourself, &#8216;one, two,
three,&#8217; and </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">I would still be dancing around, &#8216;Roberta, settle down now!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One, two, three, four, five, </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">six&#8212;Roberta!&#8217; And
that&#8217;s how it would keep going.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of
course I wasn&#8217;t always the only </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">one being a nuisance, so you might hear,
&#8216;Eighteen, nineteen, twenty&#8212;Melissa!&#8217; too, or </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.25pt;">&#8216;eight, nine, ten, eleven, Humphrey!&#8217;
But mostly it was, &#8216;Twenty-three&#8212;Roberta!&#8217;&#8221;</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">She stops and I figure this is the end of
the story though I am now sorry I wasted </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">my time trying to hear it, especially as I
can no longer move against the crowd </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">coming in like King Kong or Godzilla is
right behind them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am using my elbows
but </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">getting
practically nowhere when the old lady starts in again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;That Miss Farfel,&#8221; she is </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">saying, &#8220;was
something, let me tell you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Strict like
you wouldn&#8217;t believe.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And now I am </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">trying to yell to
people to let me out but the doors are closing, and this is when a guy in
overalls three sizes too big for him pops through like a champagne cork and </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">falls against me so
that mustard from his hot dog flies onto the tie that cost me 50 bucks and I </span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">am wearing for the first time ever.</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><font size="-1"><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">But does Granny notice?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No, she&#8217;s just prattling merrily on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Slap you for </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">chewing gum, passing notes,
anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everybody was sure she was
going to be an old </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">maid because she must already have been in her thirties, and not a man
in sight that any </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">of us girls in the class could see, and little girls can sniff things
out like that, don&#8217;t you </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">doubt it for a moment&#8221;&#8212;and now we are starting to move
again&#8212;&#8220;but then one day she </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">comes into the classroom wearing this diamond ring and
her face all red and tells us that pretty soon she is </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">going to be Mrs.
Something-or-other and how Mr. Something-or-other is the sweetest m</span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">an you ever saw, and
so smart, too, and one day he&#8217;ll be running the Coca Cola plant where he works,
and he should already be<span style="">&nbsp; </span>vice-president
except his boss is </span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">prejudiced
against him.&#8221;</span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background-image: none; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-position: 0% 50%; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><small><font size="-1"><small><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">Now I am trying to figure out what to do
next because the next couple of stops you can&#8217;t get off and reverse direction
without paying again, but still I can&#8217;t help </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">hearing the old broad say, &#8220;The next
day we have this new substitute teacher, and the </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">principal comes<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in and tells us what a tragedy it is that
Miss Freeforall passed away </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">the night before, and we all start howling and crying,
you&#8217;d have thought she&#8217;d been our best friend all our lives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But then when I got home and told my parents
about it, I </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.45pt;">could see them giving each other a funny look, so I stroll out of the
living room and listen real careful from the corridor, and I hear them
discussing how my teacher had actually been </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.35pt;">cut into a million pieces by her fiancé<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They say the autopsy showed she was pregnant
and the police had found the man, who it turned out was about twice as old as
her, sitting in the back of his delivery truck that was parked right out in front
of her apartment prying the caps off Coke bottles and adding Miss Fishface&#8217;s
blood with a </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.4pt;">funnel and then trying to seal the bottles back up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One bottle was fizzing around a finger </span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">with her diamond ring which wasn&#8217;t real
still on it.&#8221;</span></small></font></small></p>

next stop and I figure I am so late I&#8217;d better get off and pay </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; letter-spacing: -0.3pt;">the extra fare.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let me grab the sales charts from my office
so we can get into the </span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">meeting

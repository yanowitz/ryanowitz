only grandchild, Jacob. Rick and Miranda's mother, Chani, had previously
divorced but had always seemed each other's best friends, in recent years sharing a
house together to parent first&nbsp;Miranda (who will continue to live
with her mother) and then Jacob. They had planned to be central to
raising&nbsp;their grandson. &nbsp;To this end, Rick had recently left
his lawn care job to be home &nbsp;full-time, and in a private
ceremony, he and Chani re-married two days before his death.<br><br>A
memorial will take place at 3:30pm, September 14, 2012, at Hamden Hall
Country Day School (1108 Whitney Ave., Hamden, CT 06518). &nbsp;All are
welcome. &nbsp;<br><br>IF
YOU HAVE MEMORIES, MEMENTOS, PHOTOS OR ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT RICK YOU
COULD SHARE, BARBARA (brbeitch@clearwords.net) WOULD WELCOME HAVING
THEM (PREFERABLY WITHOUT CENSORHIP: SHE'S A BIG GIRL AND WOULD WELCOME
KNOWING AS MUCH ABOUT HER SON AS SHE CAN). &nbsp;We hope to put such
content&nbsp;together in a remembrance volume.<br><br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-style: italic;">For
those who want to offer a financial tribute to Rick, Barbara has set up
the Rick Beitch Memorial Fund, to be used for the arts and sports
programs (two areas in which Rick excelled at the school) at Hamden
Hall.<br><br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-style: italic;">If
you want to see postings of sympathy and memories, go to the Facebook
pages of Barbara (Beitch) and Miranda Palomino. &nbsp;I may eventually
collect and post such messages on this web site. <br><br>Rick
was born
in South Korea of a Korean mother and American GI father. &nbsp;He came
into Barbara's and Irwin's family when he was five; Barbara still has
the suit he wore when he deplaned in 1970 at JFK with other adoptees
after a long flight from Korea. &nbsp;Several years ago, and with the
encouragement of Barbara and Irwin, Rick found and met his birth
mother, who died of cancer about a year ago, and two half-brothers.<br><br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-style: italic;">A
turbulent, often troubled youth had long since given way to a
self-redeemed mensch and a life that included a close, loving
relationship in recent years between mother and son. In his room in
Dallas, I was struck by the presence of photos of his parents and
sister. &nbsp;Since I've known her, Barbara has often commented on what a rock he was for her when Irwin died in 2009.</span> &nbsp;<br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-style: italic;"><br>I
do not know how Barbara retains resilience in the face of deaths during
the last 18 years of a husband and their two children (and in her 20s, her
parents' deaths). &nbsp;But she suffers,
mourns, endures, and returns to a vibrant, full life. If anything, this terrible
event has brought us even closer.<br><br>Within a few hours of learning
of Rick's death, Barbara and I&nbsp;flew to Dallas to be supportive of
Chani, Miranda, Jacob, and Jacob's father. &nbsp;Barbara and Chani
seemed to connect especially strongly in their common grief, and the
intense two-day trip seemed to help Barbara attain some initial
closure. &nbsp;<br><br>Our wedding on June 3 now has even more meaning
to us: Rick attended, escorted us to the gazebo where the marriage
ceremony occurred, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j98ZUuvl_Yg">danced with Barbara to Louis Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World"</a>
(his choice). &nbsp;At our open house the day before, he dutifully
manned our outdoor grill for long stretches. &nbsp;His visit was the
last time Barbara saw him, though he did keep phoning her to check in,
and she has commented on how much she will miss those calls. &nbsp;<br><br>In
the midst of our mourning, we are aware that the Dallas heat wave that
contributed to Rick's death has&nbsp;been linked to global warming.
&nbsp;While human beings dither about its existence, consequences and
solutions, the&nbsp;impact of global warming and other environmental
devastation will continue, little by little, to have real consequences
to real people. &nbsp;Terrible as our own loss is to us, we are keenly
aware that vast numbers of people in far less privilged parts of the
world will more and more be&nbsp;victimized,mostly by First World (but
increasingly also by aspirants to its--apparent--economic flourishing)
exploitation and diminution of our planet's resources</span><br></font><br></td></tr></tbody></table><big><a href="file:///C:/web%20site/kompozer/Otherautobiography.html#topofpage">Top of page</a><br><a href="rickhome.html">Return to previous page</a><br></big><a href="index.html"><b>HOME PAGE</b></a>&nbsp;</body></html>

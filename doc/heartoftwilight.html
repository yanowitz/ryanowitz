Ecuador that included a couple of days in the Amazonian rain forest along the
Napo River.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first leg of the trip
was a New York-Miami-Quito flight, then overnight at a luxury hotel in Quito,
and the next morning a half-hour plane ride to the small town of Coca where you
meet a young American who works at the lodge and has come to shepherd you to
your destination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You are given a tuna
sandwich lunch and have time to walk a few blocks in what, to an American eye,
is an impoverished, poorly maintained town that includes paved streets in need
of repair and run-down stores with goods and services like toiletries, gas
cookers with a design that looks decades old, and computer repairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later you learn that little Coca is an urban
hub for people living or working along the Napo River, which runs far
inland&#8212;well beyond where you're going&#8212;to join up eventually with the
Amazon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You board a canopied riverboat
with a large outboard motor for the two-hour journey downriver to the inlet
nearest the rain forest lodge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All your
luggage has been sealed in plastic bags to protect against river (or rain)
spray and placed near the rear of the boat.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;" class="MsoNormal"><img style="width: 664px; height: 495px;" alt="Napo River, Ecuador" src="_SCN0196.jpg"></p><p class="MsoNormal">The Napo is hundreds of yards wide, and the local pilot maneuvers
the outboard motor to follow channels that crisscross the river and you, the
average tourist, can&#8217;t spot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
scenery soon becomes repetitive: turgid opaque water, the odd sandbank, along
the banks lots of trees that for all you know from this distance are oaks, the
occasional building or small grouping of buildings looking like shacks, here
and there on the riverbank indigenous-looking adults or children, one small
town.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No animals are visible in or out
of the water, though you can fantasize that a silhouette of toppled tree trunks
on a sandbank is really the outline of a crocodile or has an outgrowth that is
actually a monkey.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With a little
imagination you could be on a steamboat a hundred years and more back in time
except for the tall communications tower in the one small town and the
earth-moving vehicles being unloaded at what you later learn is an oil drilling
site not visible from the river.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When you dock, local workers moor the boat and load the
sealed luggage into a large metal cart supported by an axle with two automobile
tires and rickshaw handles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You hike
for a mile and a half along a path that is sometimes dirt (or more
realistically mud) but mostly board-walks 3 or 4 feet wide raised a foot or two
above the ground to allow for frequent flooding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The wooden walkway, topped with a stiff plasticized netting to
help you avoid slipping on the wet wood and falling into the mucky water, is
bounded by a rickety-looking handrail (in the interests of education and local
preservation, everything seems to be made of local materials) which you are
warned not to touch lest some biting ant or other noxious local denizen trouble
your progress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Behind you, a local
worker pushes (pulls?&#8212;you don&#8217;t really pay attention at the time) the loaded
luggage cart.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The walkway ends at the
arm of a lake over which you travel for 10 or 15 minutes in a dugout canoe to
the lodge itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The time it takes to
reach this destination becomes part of your touchstone for the remoteness of
your trek: 30 hours from your Manhattan apartment door.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I came to this lodge because it seemed unlikely I would ever
get a chance to be in a rain forest again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was expecting to see local fauna, especially monkeys, up close.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This doesn&#8217;t happen, and it takes me 24
hours of being bored by long hikes and distant glimpses of birds and animals to
realize that the rain forest is captivating me in quite a different way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have to take it on its own terms, not be
disappointed by an unfulfilled preconception.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In many ways the flora is more interesting than the fauna.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We learn about broad lianas that twist
around a huge tree and gradually blanket it until, after many years, they have
blocked the tree from all solar or earth nutrients and effectively suffocate
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I begin to understand that each
puddle is a temporary ecosystem that becomes extinct between rainfalls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We learn about primary and secondary growth:
the first is fully developed forest with towering trees blocking out the sky so
that it is easy to walk among them because little grows on the ground other
than plant species adapted to minimal sunlight; the latter appears after a huge
tree dies and tumbles to the forest floor, leaving behind a gash in the canopy
that allows sunlight to reach the ground cover and support low, tangling growth
in our Western image of dense jungle only negotiable via machete.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We are exposed to skills of the indigenous Quechua
(pronounced, I believe, Kichiwa) people, including a blowpipe double the length
of a person, fashioned by tightly rolling broad leaves to produce a perfectly
straight passage down its center.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
darts are made with small nicks so that a monkey cannot pull them out before
the narcotic effect of carefully gathered curare can anesthetize or kill the
monkey, which then falls from the high branches to the ground where hunters can
retrieve it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For its importance and
ingenuity such local technology is surely no less inspired than the intricate
inner workings of a Coke-dispensing machine in New York.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The lodge, staffed with young and zealous Western (mostly
American) guides&#8212;or rather &#8220;naturalists&#8221;&#8212; paired with local Quechua
specialists, seeks to convey an image of a rudimentary, rugged place in the
midst of a large, carefully protected chunk of the rain forest, a preserved and
sprawling Eden segregated from a fallen modern world.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But we also learn that the land was given or lent by one or more
foreign oil companies that own hundreds of thousands of acres for exploitation
and, to expand control, have gone so far as to bribe one band of local
tribespeople to make war on another.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lodge owners are not local nature-guardians but entrepreneurial and
absentee eco-Swiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lodge&#8217;s land
is, in fact, a tiny portion of the vaster oil company holdings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The snake is not so much inside this garden
as coiled in a surrounding boundary to foster the illusion of a relatively
pristine pastoral paradise.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In traveling from Quito to the lodge, we had in a sense gone
backwards in time, from a (relatively) modern metropolis to forest living, from
an urban population at least nominally independent (despite the obvious poverty
of many residents) to people probably treated with only slightly greater
respect than during the height of European colonialism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this rain forest the wealth of a local
family is measured by possession of a dozen or so cattle grazing on a few acres
of land held in the family&#8217;s own name (as opposed to larger tracts of land
shared by many families with no ownership but at the mercy of a tribal leader&#8217;s
decisions on who will remain or be exiled) and a house on stilts with a roof of
rusted corrugated metal salvaged from who knew where.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The family shares its living quarters and food with some of its
smaller livestock and pet local birds.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the wall are a few antique metal tools, including a rifle inherited
from World War I.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">While my adult life has been in Western cities, I grew up on
a small chicken farm in New Jersey; so I feel I understand something of the
rural-urban division that still typifies Western society.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But that experience is dwarfed by the kind
of rural-urban chasm that must exist in Ecuador.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Local forest and river people seem overwhelmingly dependent
either on subsistence or near-subsistence farming on the one hand, working for
Western concerns (like the Swiss-owned lodge and oil companies), surely at low
wages, on the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It turned out, in
fact, that while the youthful American &#8220;naturalists&#8221; eat with their tourist
charges, native guides are fed a much simpler diet in quarters physically
separated from the tourist dining room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(When they have no tourists to manage, the American guides are kept on
the same basic fare as the locals.)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Both foreign and local guides live in rudimentary shelters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or so I heard; my wanderings were shielded
from ever seeing (or at least identifying) them.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">What gradually dawns on you is that you're in a theme park
made possible by old-fashioned European colonialism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the one hand, like Disneyland the lodge and its grounds
provide a largely safe enclave that offers the illusion of adventure; on the
other hand your visit is only possible thanks to large numbers of underpaid,
smiling Indians performing the portage and housekeeping tasks for which you
have paid big bucks back in the States.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the sad economic world of the Quechua, moreover, these are plum jobs,
and the plummest seems to be supporting guide to the much younger American
naturalists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You never learn actual
wages, but you suspect that the Western guides are paid poorly by American
standards but substantially more than their local assistants.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I note this modern and recent experience as a reminder that
when it comes to how countries and people treat each other, everything is a
variation on a theme of power and control.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We in the West who are comfortably off and more (in some cases to the
extent that we can sign up for conscience-saving and excitement-aspiring
eco-tours to rain forests) try not to think about how much our well-being comes
at cost to people not so well off, whether poorer citizens in our own country,
legal and &#8220;illegal&#8221; immigrants who compete for low-paying jobs, or people in
the so-called third-world nations whom we never see but who pay the price
directly or indirectly of what we proudly call Western civilization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Reporter: &#8220;What do you think of Western
civilization?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gandhi: &#8220;I think it
would be a good idea.&#8221;)</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;" class="MsoNormal">When I decided several years ago to read about European
behavior in what to Europeans was the New World, I inherited a sense that
whatever went on&#8212;and I already knew there had been plenty of atrocities&#8212;was
somehow born ex nihilo as a result of encountering the non-European
strangeness of Western hemisphere peoples and environments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As my reading proceeded, I realized what
should always be obvious but in our historical provincialism we tend to forget:
nothing happens out of the blue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
history of colonialism (defined broadly as one people&#8217;s subjugation of another
via direct or indirect governance) shows similar behaviors across time and
culture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The early behavior of
Europeans in the Americas reflects a long history of managing captive people,
including by antique Rome, Arab slave traders, medieval Christian incursions
into the Middle East, and more recently an extension of pre-Columbian
encounters with technologically undeveloped people during penetration of the
eastern Atlantic, the West African coast, the Indian Ocean and beyond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the early post-Columbian decades it is
primarily a history of how Spanish, Portuguese and Italians (especially
Genoese) adapted old and new experience to gratify greed for imagined and real
riches.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other European nations did not
lag far behind.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;" class="MsoNormal">Aside from becoming conscious that Iberian behavior in the
New World was an extension of pre-Colombian experience, I was also surprised to
learn that in Spain (unlike, I suspect, later colonizing European nations in
the 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> centuries) there was active legal and
theological debate about acceptable ways of treating newly found people and
their intrinsically heathen cultures.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In Spanish New World colonies themselves, these debates did not count
for much, since the bulk of European populations were far away, logistically
difficult to govern, and typically dismissive of distant edicts that differed
from their on-the-ground desires and experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still, it is intriguing that the debates went on at all and that
even in Spanish America occasional voices questioned the most heavy-handed
colonial techniques.</p>

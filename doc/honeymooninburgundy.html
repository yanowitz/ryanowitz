<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><b style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">THE
BARGE<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It&#8217;s just over six weeks since Maxine and I married (May
15).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had two honeymoons: 3 days in
the Berkshires right after the wedding, and two weeks in France starting on
June 7.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The French visit was built around a 5 ½ day barge trip
(Sunday afternoon to Saturday morning from Montbard to Tanlay) on a Burgundy
canal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The barge, named the <i>Joie de
Vivre</i>, is part of a trend that seems to have spread across Europe: to
resurrect decrepit canal barges as luxury cruise accommodations for a small
number of people&#8212;a dozen plus or minus.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I doubt I will ever eat or drink (wine) again as good as what was served
on the barge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The slow travel&#8212;surely no
faster than a person strolls&#8212;on a waterway&nbsp;meandering through rural landscapes,
sometimes paralleling a road, was serene.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The trip started with a van picking us up outside cousin
Annie&#8217;s<a style="" href="honeymooninburgundy.html#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style=""><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[1]<!--[endif]--></span></span></a>
apartment in Paris.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another passenger
was waiting at the same location, a fellow from South Carolina, probably in his
late 60s, who called himself JR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
exuded bluster and narcissism, and during the wait for the pick-up and then the
long ride to the barge (altogether over three hours), Maxine and I were fretting
that we would have a terrible time, that all passengers would be like JR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was ready to play the honeymoon card: to say that Maxine and I didn&#8217;t mean to be antisocial, but because
we were on our honeymoon we were going to be pretty private and keep to ourselves.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In fact, there were two other couples with whom we got along
great.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of us luxuriated in the food,
peace, quiet, extensive reading, and land tours to places of greater and lesser
interest within an hour or so&#8217;s drive of the canal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maxine and I still think of this as the most peaceful time we&#8217;ve
had together.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The trip had a couple of down sides.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had registered and paid for the one room
that was advertised as an upgrade over the others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On arrival at the barge, we discovered this room had been given
to another couple.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We complained, and
since one of the five cabins was empty, we were given two rooms with a
connecting door, which helped us feel less cramped.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Summer was late this year, and early in our Paris visit we
were chilly at times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Half-way through
the barge trip, however, the worst of summer heat and humidity struck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The AC in our room on the barge was almost
useless, a fact that greatly interfered with the sense of &#8220;luxury&#8221; and kept us
out of the room most of our waking time.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Let me conclude this summary by dwelling a bit on JR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My first impression was of a man who expected
others to adapt to his way of life, which appeared to be conservative,
politically and otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Paris a
couple of days earlier a pickpocket had stolen my wallet on a bus near my
aunt&#8217;s home in the 20<sup>th</sup> arrondissement, a relatively poor,
working-class and immigrant part of Paris, and JR&#8217;s first question when I
recounted the event was about the color of the thief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Within the first couple of days of the trip, he made at least
three disparaging references to Japanese.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the drive to the barge he referred to &#8220;Japs&#8221;; normally I feel
obligated to respond when I hear such things, but sitting in the back seat, I
chose instead to pretend I was concentrating on a book and hadn&#8217;t heard
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day he made a reference
to Japanese gardeners, and I simply walked away from him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the Tuesday, he made some remark about
Japanese tourists, and I said, &#8220;Were you in the War?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You seem to have an animus against the Japanese.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He replied that he was praising them, but he
made no further mention (in my hearing, at any rate) during the trip.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">JR had in recent years become fixated on wine, and while he apparently did know a
great deal about it he seemed incapable of letting anyone forget that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the barge, he had an opinion about
everything.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">But as the days passed I began to feel sorry for him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, he told us that his sweetheart
(&#8220;lady,&#8221; I think he called her) was unable to come: she had been in a car
accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Within the next couple of
days, he said something that forced any listener (in this case, me) to ask:
&#8220;What happened to your wife?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It turned
out she was killed in 1999 by a drunk driver; and his current &#8220;lady&#8221; had
recently been badly hurt (though not fatally) in an accident with a drunk
driver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It became apparent that JR was
a very sad man who put on a show of total self-possession (having told us this
brief history, he immediately added that it was his problem to deal with).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also became apparent that rather than
expecting people to conform to his life context (or perhaps he just gave up on
that when no one took the bait), he was desperate to feel that the rest of us
accepted him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Apparently JR had made a good deal of money years earlier by
inventing some crucial tool for the oil business, and he had relatively
recently taken up wine importing out of personal interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I doubt he makes much money out of it, but that doesn't matter: it makes him happy.<a style="" href="honeymooninburgundy.html#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style=""><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[2]<!--[endif]--></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="MsoNormal">Maxine and I avoided JR as much as possible
(the other two couples agreed to take turns riding in the van in which he rode;
two vans ferried us around), and I&#8217;m not sorry we did so, but I find that
after the trip I feel a bit guilty that I didn&#8217;t engage with such an obviously
sad and repressed&#8212;albeit tedious&#8212;man.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><b style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">AGRICULTURAL
CONSCIOUSNESS<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">One key intellectual experience stands out about this
trip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the first time I can
remember, I felt an intense interest in agriculture<a style="" href="honeymooninburgundy.html#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style=""><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[3]<!--[endif]--></span></span></a>&#8212;or rather, in the role agriculture plays in culture and its evolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;d driven cross-country through Iowa and
Nebraska decades ago, and I don&#8217;t remember being any more than bored with the
landscape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the huge fields on the
hilly Burgundy landscape fascinated me and sometimes even made my heart soar
with excitement.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal">I think I was seeing, or letting myself see, the signs of
how civilizations have originated, both for good and ill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Looking at a wheat field, for example,&nbsp;I found myself trying to count stalks in a tiny subsection and &#8220;seeing&#8221; one or a few
stalks being planted by the first humans who experimented with farming.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I guessed at how many subsections made up each
dimension of the field, multiplied for a rough figure of total stalks, divided
by a guess at how many stalks made a loaf of bread to arrive at an estimate of
how many loaves of bread that field represented. &nbsp;Then I multiplied&nbsp;by an
estimate of the population of France for a number that represented how many
fields it would take to supply a day&#8217;s worth of bread for France, and then&nbsp;a year&#8217;s worth.<a style="" href="honeymooninburgundy.html#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style=""><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[4}</span></span></a>&nbsp; (I've forgotten the numbers, but they were impressive.)</p><p class="MsoNormal">Ignoring for the moment the potential unreliability of crop
production over many years, I thought about how farming could stabilize a
society&#8217;s food supply and allow groups to remain in one place, or at least have
a fixed base for an extended period of time, and of the division of labor such
a system would quickly prompt: the ability to feed more than a small number of
people would easily encourage some with more power than others to decide who
has to farm and who got to do other things, including being taken care of by the farmers.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By happenstance, for the trip I had brought along Clarence
Glacken&#8217;s <i>Traces on the Rhodian Shore</i>, which I started to read on the
third day of the barge trip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
blended
with this agricultural interest, for it was looking at the history of
the
relationship between environment and culture in western thought; and
focus on
agriculture was central to that theme. &nbsp;[2007 note: Since that
time I found myself reading a number of books on the origins of
"civilization."]</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><b style=""><span style="font-family: Arial;">PARIS AND FAMILY<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The six days we spent in Paris before and after the barge
trip included a good deal of time with family.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We were taken out to dinner three times&#8212;once, by Mathilde and with Henry, to a small working-class bistro
near Mathilde&#8217;s home; once, by Henry, Christine and Annie,&nbsp;to a charming
nightclub-restaurant, and the last time two days before we returned to the US:
by Jai, who&nbsp; invited a total of a dozen people (including one of his two grandsons) to a
the Blue Elephant, a posh Thai restaurant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He and his wife, Marie-Francoise, had flown from Rodez at least in part
to meet Maxine and me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Annie, with whom we stayed (and with whom the family tried
to fix me up when I came to Paris for 6 months&nbsp;in 1965) was wrestling
with dissatisfaction with her boyfriend of perhaps 14 year;
she was also into what I can only describe as eclectic new age-related ideas
(kabbalah, self-help TV gurus, writings of the apocryphal Egyptian Hermes Trismegistus<a style="" href="honeymooninburgundy.html#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style=""><comment title="[if !supportFootnotes]" xmlns="http://disruptive-innovations.com/zoo/nvu"><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--></comment>[5]<comment title="[endif]" xmlns="http://disruptive-innovations.com/zoo/nvu"></comment></span></span></a>&nbsp;to name&nbsp;a few).&nbsp;<span style=""> </span>But she was also totally
attentive, gracious and appreciative that we were there, and we spent much time
talking.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Annie had no AC&#8212;par for Paris apartments; an air conditioner
can cost several thousand dollars, and energy is quite expensive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(While Parisians I have met often have
laundry machines, they tend not to have clothes dryers.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But because Maxine and I have been spoiled
by AC in our US homes, it was especially hard to adapt to the heat, and I felt
like the stereotype of a fussy American abroad as I struggled with my discomfort earlier on
the barge and now at Annie&#8217;s.<span style="">&nbsp; She</span> gave us
what may have been her only fan, which was a big help, and I had learned years ago, before I had AC,
that a shower before going to bed would typically cool me off for the night.<a style="" href="honeymooninburgundy.html#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style=""><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[6]<!--[endif]--></span></span></a></p>

<p class="stbllabel" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Written </span></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">June 30, 2005</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">On the metro to meet the rest of the family before going to
the Blue Elephant, Maxine spotted Mathilde in our car, and so we walked with
her to her granddaughter&#8217;s, Marie&#8217;s, house where we were all meeting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While walking from the Metro, she described
the neighborhood&#8217;s recent history: the Chinese (it wasn&#8217;t clear if this meant
long-resident Chinese or relatively recent immigrants) had been buying up all
retail property for their own businesses, such as warehousing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result, traditional small shops common
to all Paris neighborhoods&#8212;I can think only of food shops like bakeries and butcher
shops, but perhaps there were others, like dry cleaners&#8212;no longer existed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;The Chinese will eat us,&#8221; she said with
great venom, &#8220;they will eat us.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
tone made the metaphor border on literalism.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don&#8217;t remember her exact solution, but it was along the lines of
uprooting all the Chinese at fault and restoring the defunct neighborhood
shops, sending all Chinese back to China, certainly not allowing the pattern to
continue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I made a half-hearted
demurral, but then left it alone.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Especially given her political roots (I think they were similar
to Hy&#8217;s communism) I was quite taken aback by her position, thinking of
chauvinism back home and my smatterings of knowledge about Le Pen in
France.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At Marie&#8217;s apartment, I
mentioned this conversation to Jai, who, in a more detached tone than his mother,
launched into a similar account in almost identical words, minus the ones about
getting eaten.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I jokingly asked if he
had voted for Le Pen, and he explained how (like most French people) he had
voted for Chirac as the lesser evil.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
don&#8217;t know if he got my point about Le Pen&#8217;s anti-immigration appeal.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Now I was really flustered, though I told myself that I had
never really known Jai&#8217;s politics.<a style="" href="honeymooninburgundy.html#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style="">[7]</span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>His solution to the problem was similar to
Mathilde&#8217;s, though perhaps did not include sending Chinese back to China.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When I later mentioned these discussions to Henry, whose
politics are still well on the left, he repeated the description of the
situation almost verbatim, so that I suspect this is a widely discussed issue
that adopts the same terminology over and over, as in the US abortion or Iraq
&#8220;debates&#8221; (as I write, the US is in its second year of occupying Iraq after the
overthrow of Saddam Hussein) typically repeat familiar arguments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Henry was struggling to adopt a more humane
answer, some kind of compromise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
the power of the problem was palpable for him as well.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I found these concerns from relatives especially troubling
because they were part of a group&#8212;North Africans in general, Tunisians in
particular&#8212;that had undergone considerable discrimination and mistrust
themselves.<a style="" href="honeymooninburgundy.html#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span class="MsoEndnoteReference"><span style=""><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[8]<!--[endif]--></span></span></a></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We have had parallel issues in the US, more I think about
franchised corporations driving out small businesses than about neighborhood
character disappearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We certainly
see cases in which residents of a neighborhood can get up in arms about pressure for local
changes, as in clamor over school busing to end de facto segregation or what
one wears to school (I have shared the cynicism that much sentiment invoking
"tradition" is a cover for darker motives like racism), and we have been plagued
by calls to retain or restore &#8220;traditional&#8221; values like school prayer or
purging of library books or allowing religious (usually Christian) symbols in
public places.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal">But I suspect Americans feel less strongly about issues akin
to creeping sinoization of&nbsp;city neighborhoods because of two traditions:
(1) the virtue of capitalism (if Barnes and Noble drives out the independent
book store or Wal-Mart bankrupts numerous small businesses, that&#8217;s the way
competition works&#8212;and anyway, each of us wants to buy as cheaply as possible
regardless of long-term or seemingly ancillary effects like lower wages for
strangers) and (2) our melting-pot tradition in which we are supposed to
welcome people from many backgrounds and celebrate what has lately come to be called
diversity.<o:p></o:p><br clear="all">

back, my son gave me an exercise to estimate something for which I had no
information&#8212;in that case, how long it would take a cannonball to sink at the
middle of the Pacific Ocean.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
exercise demonstrated that you could make uninformed guesses for each
factor&#8212;the depth of the ocean, the weight of the cannonball, the
acceleration as it sank, maybe some other factors as you diagnosed the
problem&#8212;and that the mistakes for each parameter tended to cancel out
so that you
came up with a not-unrealistic answer.<span style="">&nbsp;

supply.</p>

tub-shower, like many in Europe&#8212;well, based on my experience in Paris and
Florence&#8212;was a small affair with no curtains.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You sit or kneel in the tub and hold the showerhead, on a flexible metal
hose, close to your body so it does not splash out of the tub.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The apartment rented at 61 Rue des Haies (phone number PYRenees 43-31) in the 20<sup>th</sup>
by&nbsp;Hy and&nbsp;Mathilde starting in 1950 had no shower, and for many
years the family would go to public baths down the street<span style=""> </span>By the time I stayed there with them in 1965,
they had put in a shower.</p>

decades or so earlier, when he told me about his work advising French farmers

food.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His comment was that when France
was as well off as the United States, the country would worry about such

treating me like someone who repented a life that had provided and was at some

when Hy was dying of a heart condition and in bed for rest, a knife fight broke
out in the courtyard of their Rue des Haies apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mathilde, worrying in
part about the effect of the noise on Hy&#8217;s heart, phoned the police, while I
think Jai ran into the courtyard and tried to shoo the fighters away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I stood by and watched.) &nbsp;The policeman who answered Mathilde's call asked
whether the fighters were North African, the clear implication being that if so

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;"><span style="color: black;">The priest reassured him, speaking mildly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Go on, faithful one.&#8221;</span><span style="color: black;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

race to the village like the wind itself, the priest said slowly and solemnly,
&#8220;Lead me to these men.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We shall see if
they are the Messengers of the Prophecy.&#8221;</span><span style="color: black;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;"><span style="color: black;">The Americans had not planned to make discoveries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their expedition was to make charts and
gather data.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when they came upon
the village, a place listed on no map, it would have been unthinkable not to
investigate.</span><span style="color: black;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText3">The leader of the expedition, John Keenacks, literally
stumbled on the unknown village.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Keenacks was ordinarily a professor of anthropology at Columbia
University, currently on leave to work for the CIA&#8217;s exploration teams in the
Himalayas, thanks to his close knowledge of Indian and Chinese dialects.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;"><span style="color: black;">He was walking along a shallow ledge when he<b> </b>slipped,
rolled down fifty yards of sixty degree, smooth, snow-packed slope, and came to
rest with his face staring at a spot a hundred yards below and in front of him,
where two ledges formed a cleft a few feet wide that gave a view into a vast
pocket of level ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Through the
cleft Keenacks saw, during a momentary lull in the swirling snow, at least a
dozen men.</span><span style="color: black;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;"><span style="color: black;">Keenacks&#8217;<b> </b>four companions had already found their
way down the slope to him, breathing heavily from trying to run in the thin
air, by the time his mind forgot its astonishment sufficiently to examine
himself for broken bones.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing
seemed seriously hurt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With chagrin he
recognized a broad bruise in his lower ribs, where the can of peaches in his
pack had dug into him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only
burdensome luxury they had let him bring, he thought, and look where it got
him.</span><span style="color: black;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;"><span style="color: black;">He told his companions what he had seen.</span><span style="color: black;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;"><span style="color: black;">&#8220;You sure it wasn&#8217;t just something&#8212;in your mind, from the
fall?&#8221; asked Len Dunjohn, from the Rand Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was the other anthropologist in the expedition, also chosen
for his language ability.</span><span style="color: black;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;"><span style="">&#8220;No.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Absolutely not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are men down there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If they&#8217;re the enemy, we&#8217;d better find out
damned fast, before they find us.&#8221;</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;"><span style="">It took them three hours to find a route down, most of it along a sheer
cliff in which they left hand spikes in case they had to get back up in a
hurry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They gathered together to peer
through the cleft, and what they saw was a village with several dozen huts, all
but one set together in the open, the other nestled protectively beneath a
ledge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Men and women and children were
working and playing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Their dress looked
like a scanty cloth, covering their bodies and heads but leaving their faces
exposed to the cold.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;"><span style="">There was no point in hiding.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Americans stepped forward, not knowing what to expect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Several dozen people began babbling loudly
as soon as they spotted the strangers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Apparently attracted by the noise, an old man, with a long white beard
exposed outside his clothing, emerged from the isolated hut.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was stooped but dignified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one showed hostility.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;"><span style="">Both Keenacks and Dunjohn could readily understand the language, a
minor variant of a common Chinese dialect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After initial, awkward greetings, the old man<b>, </b>apparently the
village leader, asked, &#8220;From where have you come?&#8221;</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;"><span style="">&#8220;The United States of America,&#8221; replied Keenacks.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;"><span style="">&#8220;Where is that village?&#8221; the old man asked.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;"><span style="">Keenacks controlled his surprise.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>&#8220;It is in the west, many leagues away&#8212; thousands and thousands of
leagues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a land of many
villages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>White men like us inhabit
that land.&#8221;</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;"><span style="">&#8220;And why are you here?&#8221;</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;"><span style="">&#8220;We&#8212;uh&#8212;stumbled upon your village, my lord.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Keenacks ventured the title without knowing what its effect would
be, and the old man looked neither pleased nor displeased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;We are exploring this area, searching for&#8212;uh&#8212;new
routes to China.&#8221;</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;"><span style="">&#8220;China?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is that another
village?&#8221;</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;"><span style="">Keenacks looked for a moment at Dunjohn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The old man&#8212;if he could be believed&#8212;did not know of China; this
village was truly isolated!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
studies could be made!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, of
course&#8212;what a wonderful opportunity to establish an American outpost here, once
studies had been completed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There might
be a little trouble with the CIA boys about holding off on setting up a base,
but he&#8217;d manage.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;"><span style="">&#8220;China is a land that lies many leagues to your east, my lord.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A land of men with skin like yourself, but
men, I regret to say, of evil, not of good.&#8221;</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;"><span style="">&#8220;And you, sir, are men of good, then?&#8221;</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;"><span style="">Keenacks attempted to look modestly embarrassed, not knowing if the
expression would have meaning here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;We
try to be, my lord.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one is perfect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But we try.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We believe in freedom&#8212;uh&#8212;individual freedom, you see.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Might as well make a first inroad on them,
he thought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;For example, we are
pleased and honored to meet your worship, and we look forward to future
meetings with you and your people.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We&#8212;uh&#8212;encourage the existence of independent...villages like your
own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chinese land, my lord, were
they to learn of your existence, would wish only to enslave your people and
turn you to their own use.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Damn it, he
thought, how do you explain political subtleties to innocent people?</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;"><span style="">The old man spoke.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Our Legends
tell of strange peoples in the world, but I must tell you, honored guest, that
our village has long been isolated from<i> </i>the outside world, and we have
only the ancient bales of the affairs of other men.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We will be truly honored if you will accept our hospitality, and
the use of my own hut during your stay, which I trust shall be for many days.&#8221;</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

thought, this is an incredible opportunity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He bowed awkwardly in his stiff fur<i> </i>parka.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;My countrymen and I are most honored by
your offer, but we do not wish to disturb you, and we have our own living
quarters with us.&#8221;</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>The boy went out and brought back a tray with wooden spoons, bowls, and
a large pot of steaming broth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
disappeared, and Keenacks was about to serve the broth, when the boy came back
with a bowl full of something that looked like fruit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Taking the serving spoon from Keenacks (who was interested in the
wooden handle, which was intricately carved in a design that represented two
lovers in a pose that could well have been from the <i>Kama Sutra</i>), the boy
proceeded to dole out helpings and pass the bowls around.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

large bowl the boy had brought in, and squatted next to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He reached for<i> </i>one of the objects in
it, but Keenacks hissed at him, &#8220;Don&#8217;t touch it, George!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Liebowitz&#8217;s hand snapped back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Keenacks went on in a calmer voice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t mean to scare you&#8212;just don&#8217;t want to
break protocol, you understand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The boy
seems to serve<i> </i>things, and there&#8217;s no telling what insult we&#8217;d be making
if we didn&#8217;t let him.&#8221;</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

point in whispering, since the boy surely spoke no English.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Liebowitz looked at the others and said
aloud, &#8220;Somehow, they&#8217;ve got contact with the outside world.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They must!<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;"><span style="">Everyone was silent for several moments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The boy had finished doling the soup; a steaming bowl sat in
front of each man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were all
hungry, but none touched his soup.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;"><span style="">Mott said to Liebowitz, &#8220;George, do you suppose the soup&#8217;s poisoned?&#8221;</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>He fished his spoon around in the liquid, lifted out a large chunk of
something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He blew on the spoon, picked
up the object with his fingers, wincing a little at the heat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He held it to his nose, easily squashed it
with his fingers, touched it to his tongue.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

morsel around on his tongue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;It&#8217;s a
potato!&#8221; He paused while the others looked at each other and at the boy, who
was standing to one side, looking confused and upset.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Liebowitz said, &#8220;But I suppose they might have developed some

</span>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one possible explanation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Chinese must have a nuclear center here, built right into the

with the added fortune that they were buried in the ground reserved for the Old
One<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(and would perhaps make the most
famous Burial Place in the village&#8217;s history, linking the priest&#8217;s reign with
glory), had greatly improved the chances for the survival of the village.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

wide-spread damage, almost as if the Great Father had held the clouds back and
let the sun shine through for hundreds of days on<i> </i>end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the damage was not permanent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The village would have to ration its food
for less than a tenth of a lifetime, but some of every crop had survived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A harvest would soon be made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most of it would have to go for new planting
now, but with the supplies on hand and what could safely be eaten of the
harvest, food could be rationed so that none would starve.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

not going at once to reassure the others, but needing the rest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His shoulder was throbbing, and he was very
tired.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;"><span style="">He thought back over the Legends and the Prophecy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hundreds of lifetimes ago, the Great Father
had created the Village, and had sent his Messengers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each legend described the Messengers slightly differently, but
most agreed that they came in suits of heavy fur, with strange, transparent
globes hiding their heads.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

made manifest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Messengers taught
about the Great Father of the Snows.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They explained that only so long as the villagers had faith would the
crops thrive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From time to time, they
warned, a villager would grow up who doubted the existence of the Great Father
of the Snows, who refused to believe in the divine fertility of the snows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The withering of a crop was evidence of an
Unbeliever, and the villagers would conduct a search at the first bad sign.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Unbeliever always confessed, and was
sacrificed, on rare occasions even repenting sufficiently to commit
self-sacrifice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dead ground would
be re-consecrated and the remaining crops would be expanded to keep the food
supply constant, just as the population of the village had been kept carefully
constant over the centuries&#8212;that was part of the Old One&#8217;s job.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;"><span style="">And the Prophecy had told of the eventual re-coming of the Messengers,
when the Garden would be returned to its first glory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the Prophecy had also warned of the appearance of false
messengers, disguised as true ones.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
soon as such visitors saw the crops they would disbelieve, so that the fields
would be ravaged in a very short time.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

something to the Old One, and for the second time that day, and the second time

astonishment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the second time that
day, the villagers saw Father O-Shen act undignified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stopped in the middle of his sentence, walked to the Old

from proof-reading the scanned pages, I have made only two changes (two
matching words) to this story to correct an inconsistency whichI missed when I wrote this over 40 years ago. </p><p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;">While I find some of the writing and plotting in this story good,
I find it also riddled with problems that I don't have the patience to
fix. &nbsp;Most glaringly, this is a science fiction story that depends
on plot rather than character, a problem I didn't understand at the
time, and&nbsp;the characters are pretty one-dimensional. &nbsp;I also
over-write,&nbsp;too often telling rather than showing, hitting the
reader over the head with some of the back story of the village, and
using descriptive terms, especially adverbs, unnecessarily. &nbsp;So I
don't know if anyone will ever read this, though my grandchildren may
be curious at some point at how I wrote as a young man.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0%; -moz-background-clip: initial; -moz-background-origin: initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: initial;">I
do find the story interesting for what it says about my thinking at the
age of 23 or 24. &nbsp;(It is hard not to be condescending to my former
self...) &nbsp;I can see I was influenced by the story of Shangri-La
(which I never read; but I'd seen the movie),&nbsp;American paranoia
about communism, cultural relativism/anthropology (though, to my regret, I never formally studied it),
and Milton (at least the reference to Good coming from Evil). &nbsp;I
am also intrigued that I did not make the mountain group perfect; at
least, I assume that the idea of sacrificing dissenters for the greater
good would have offended me then as it does now. &nbsp;Certainly I
remember being very conscious of my own role as a maverick and my
hatred of abusing people who buckedpopular thought. </p>

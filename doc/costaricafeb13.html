<p style="font-style: italic;" class="MsoBodyText2">Early morning we&#8217;ll depart from Manuel Antonio and begin
our remote Osa adventure. By mid-afternoon we&#8217;ll arrive in the frontier town of
Puerto Jiminez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a short
instruction, we&#8217;ll board sea-kayaks and paddle out onto the pristine Golfito
Bay and search for dolphins and whales. We&#8217;ll stay out on the water and watch a
spectacular sunset highlighted by the silhouette of the misty rainforest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once the sun has gone completely down, we&#8217;ll
don snorkeling gear for a magical nighttime swim amongst the bioluminescent
plankton. Best on a dark, moonless night, trails of bioluminescent sparkles
follow your every move! This is truly a magical experience. Finally, we&#8217;ll
kayak back, still marveling every time our paddles dip into the glittering
water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This evening we&#8217;ll enjoy dinner
at a local restaurant and lodge. Puerto Jiminez is also one of the best stops
on the trip to see squirrel monkeys. Overnight at Parrot Bay Lodge or Black
Turtle Lodge</p>

<p class="stblpara">Another lousy breakfast buffet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I sit with E and M, and I tell E he is my new model for what a
mensch is.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He first thinks I&#8217;m teasing,
but I say, no, I&#8217;m serious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am
especially appreciative of how he helped balance me for the whitewater trip,
but I have noticed other little things he has done that have been very
sensitive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I do not mention how he
annoyed me with some of his picture-taking.)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He says I don&#8217;t really know him, and I say maybe, but this is what I&#8217;ve
observed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(After the trip I wonder if
he is much more difficult in his ordinary life, and if, as is often true for
me, he is freed up when he travels, or at least on this trip.)</p>

<p class="stblpara">E goes his way to return to San Jose, and the rest of us, a
bit bereft, proceed on the bus towards Panama, to Golfito.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have a rest stop in a small town.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I take a number of photos, including one of
a bank front where an armed guard looking like the one in Santa Elena seems to
wag a finger at me to stop, but I&#8217;ve already moved on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I see what I think is our first traffic
light since San Jose.</p><p class="stblpara">In Golfito we have a mediocre lunch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We tip Ruben (I think Maxine and I plan tips
for him and Koky that are more than others, or most others; I&#8217;m very aware that
these people count on tips as part of their income) and he takes the bus back
to its origin; he has also prepared for each person/party a map of Costa Rica
with the route indicated with a highlighter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I have wanted something like this the entire trip, and I&#8217;m grateful to
have it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now I have a much better idea
of where we have gone.</p>

<p class="stblpara">It is especially hot. Outside the restaurant is our boat to
cross the gulf, tiny, with a single motor and a small canopied steering area in
the middle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The boat is just about big
enough to hold the eight of us and the &#8220;captain.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hand him our luggage to stow in a compartment beneath the boy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I hand him my backpack I point to my
book (<i>Nature</i>) hanging loose from the webbing, and he seems to wave a
reassurance that it will be fine.</p>

<p class="stblpara">We had been told the crossing from Golfito to&nbsp;Puerto
Jiminez on the Osa Peninsula would be smooth, but apparently this was an
unusual day, because the first 2/3 or so of the 45-minute trip are choppy and
we all get soaked as the boat bounces and sends up spray.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m desperately trying to protect my camera
from the seawater, and I get annoyed when I see several of the others working
to figure out how to protect M&#8217;s (better) camera, which they do with a large
piece of plastic they find.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eventually,
Koky takes our cameras and stows them with the luggage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the ride I hold on to a blue-green
rope attached near the bow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although I
fantasize being thrown out of the boat, I&#8217;m not sure how much I really think
grasping the rope will keep me from doing so and how much it just steadies me
against the choppiness.</p>


<p class="stblpara">At the dock we walk to a van that drives us to our lodging
for the night, the <i>Tortuga Negra</i>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Part way there I realize <i>Nature </i>is missing (also a couple of
pencils and the Costa Rican map).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am
annoyed, especially thinking about how I let the captain seem reassuring.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Koky phones the company and tells me the
owner assures him that the captain will get it and leave it at the company&#8217;s
town office in the morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am mildly
reassured.</p>

<p class="stblpara">The lodge staggers Maxine and me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Off and on during the trip, I have chided her for asking
questions that anticipate problems with accommodations, and she had started to
do so again yesterday evening about tonight&#8217;s lodging.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are several 2-story wood buildings
with separate, shared bathrooms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are
upstairs with no running water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
another setting that reminds me of a large camp room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lighting is terrible, but by this time I have come to adapt
by reading with my headlamp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I make a
small stink about having an enlarged prostate and what a pain this will be in
the middle of the night, though I add to the owner, who seems nice and proud of
his lodge, that I blame not him but Josh.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Others in our group offer to trade with us, but I say no because I can&#8217;t
bear packing up again (nor am I happy about acting like such a loser),
especially since we&#8217;ve hung out to dry all our wet clothes from the
crossing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Koky tells me not to blame
Josh because he has never been here; I don&#8217;t say to him what I think&#8212;that it&#8217;s
Josh&#8217;s job to have vetted places, especially when he reassures clients about
what they'll be like.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maxine reminds me
that she had been explicit with Josh that she counts on having a private
bathroom.</p>

<p class="stblpara">I am now very very cranky, feeling marginalized and trapped.</p>

<p class="stblpara">Before dinner we go kayaking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lodge van takes us to the embarkation point, which is to my
eyes a run-down backwoods kind of place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don&#8217;t bring my camera (or binoculars) in case I capsize.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I choose a kayak without any knowledge<span style="">&nbsp; </span>of what to look for, and anyway by the time
I get to mine everyone else has chosen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We have two guides.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One lingers
with me as I lag.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Something is wrong
with my seat, and I am quickly getting exhausted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The guide tries to fix it, then offers to switch kayaks with
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I assume his is much better.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the water is shallow enough for me
to stand, I find myself terrified of getting from my kayak to the water, and I
awkwardly but finally transfer to the other kayak without getting in the water
while the guide tries to steady both kayaks.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don&#8217;t know why I find it so scary.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At least I&#8217;m in the better kayak now&#8212;until I discover that one of the
ratchet adjustable foot pads is broken.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At first I think this is not as bad as the seat problem, but before long
it seems just as bad to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By now I am
way behind the group and soon don&#8217;t even want to catch up with them even though
the guide says he can see dolphins where they are.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He encourages me to take it easy, gives me a spiel similar to the
one I later learn the other guide gives everyone else.</p>

<p class="stblpara">I am full of rage, though I don&#8217;t express it; in fact, I try
hard to talk in a casual, conversational tone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Why could I not get a proper kayak?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Why should the weakest kayaker get stuck with the worst kayak?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why has cheapskate Josh contracted with a
company that doesn&#8217;t keep its supplies in good shape?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why wasn&#8217;t I better looked after in choosing a kayak?</p>

<p class="stblpara">Instead of trying to join the rest of the group, we cut
across the bay to an interim shore stop.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My guide has baked lemon squares.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I have one; it&#8217;s delicious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
wait for the others as the twilight turns to<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a bit of
fog.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maxine is the last one in, but I
am reassured that although I can&#8217;t see her the other guide must still be out
there with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When everyone is in and
has had a lemon square, a few go in the water to observe bioluminescence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I dawdle but eventually put on a jacket and
join the others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are all standing in
shallow, warm water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eventually we
start to see sparkles in the water that resemble fireflies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trip was supposed to include snorkeling;
now one of the guides has brought out one or two snorkeling masks which we can
use to look at the lights underwater.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
can&#8217;t believe that <i>this </i>is the extent of the advertised snorkeling
experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I use one mask&#8212;by now on
the trip we&#8217;ve all shared so much food and drink that I barely think about
sanitation&#8212;and dip my face in the water briefly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon I feel pain on my legs as if something is biting me or
pulling at my leg hairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think it
must be paranoia because I&#8217;ve found so much go wrong, but others start feeling
the same thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I forget what the
critters are called that are doing the biting.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We all leave the water.</p>

<p class="stblpara">Now we must paddle back to where we began.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I get in my original kayak so that at least
I can plant my feet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the distance I
can see the light that demarcates the location, and it doesn&#8217;t look unbearably
far, but once I&#8217;m paddling I begin to be in agony and feel desperate at the
distance I must cover.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same guide
lags with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stroke 3, 4, 5, maybe
up to 10 times here and there then collapse in exhaustion to re-gather my
strengthen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ask the guide if the
current is against me and he says yes, so I am scared that I will keep losing
any distance I gain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, I don&#8217;t
seem to go backwards in relation to the shore.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Everybody else is out of sight ahead.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although the guide will make sure I go in the right direction, I orient
myself by the shore on my left and the target light in the distance ahead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My thighs keep getting exhausted and
painful; although I can get leverage with my feet, the seat slides around so
much that I&#8217;m not sure the leverage helps.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A few times I emit a guttural cry of frustration as I try to force
myself to make one further paddling motion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I wonder if I can make it and what happens if I can&#8217;t; I guess that my
guide will go to shore, get the other guide with a double kayak, and come back
to retrieve me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I want to cry.</p>

<p class="stblpara">If we followed the others, we would be taking a roundabout
way to bring our kayaks back to their origin.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But my guide sees that I am desperate, calls ahead that we can&#8217;t come
around that way, and gets out of his kayak into the shallow water&#8212;maybe a foot
high&#8212;to tow his boat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has earlier
told me I could get out and walk, but my anxiety about the water makes me
resist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or maybe I think that will be
even harder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now however I get out and
he ties my towrope to the back of his own.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He walks ahead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cross a
sandbank for perhaps 20 yards, then there is more wading before we are back on
land for good.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I plod slowly, steadily,
carrying my paddle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After what seems a
long time I make it to land and back to the others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="stblpara">At dinner I&#8217;m in a terrible mood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everyone, including Maxine, lobbies for a stop tomorrow in a
reserve off the road to Luna Lodge; the kayak guide this evening mentioned it
as a wonderful place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have been
looking forward to relaxing at Luna, and I&#8217;m dismayed at this potential
delay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My own guide had mentioned that
somewhere around here thousands of monkeys had been found dead and autopsies
had not yet revealed the cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Later
I&#8217;ll hear that it might have been a few dozen monkeys, and that the cause is
known.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="stblpara">G does his usual schtick about how he just wants to stay at
the <i>Tortuga Negra </i>indefinitely.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Everyone other than Maxine seems to love the place, and I guess it is
delightful to a certain taste that is less comfort-concerned (less spoiled American?) than Maxine or I
(at least by this point in the trip).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
feel more marginal than I can remember in years (also: the lodge owner is a
culinary institute grad who cooks chicken that to me is a bit tough; ceviche,
though, tastes good).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I fuss about box lunches and wanting to know
what will be&nbsp;in them, not just accept anything (remember the &#8220;chicken or beef?&#8221; on
our flight here?).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Others encouraged me
to persevere when I quickly gave up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
kvetch about some of the other food on the trip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They ask what I thought about this food.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Me: It is fair (no explanation re dry
chicken).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few of us do arrange for
chicken sandwiches for tomorrow; I hope my sandwich will have something to give
it moisture. &nbsp;I kvetch about my
general unhappiness<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and gripe about feeling so different when others are happy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>People seem surprised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
says something reassuring.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="stblpara">I go off to
bed, talk with Maxine about all this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
finish her poem and, with difficulty copy it into her card.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I work on a puzzle (all this by
headlamp, a good reading light but reminder of the shortcomings of the
room).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Go to sleep 10:15, wake 12:15,
need to pee, go downstairs with Maxine.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Back in bed I obsess about all my resentments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Work on puzzle.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Up at 5:30 to pee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sleep a little more or maybe not at all.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><a style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);" href="https://richardyanowitz.com/costarica_final_entries.html"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif; font-weight: bold; color: black;">Go to:</span><br></a><a style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;" href="arrivalinstructions.html">Arrival instructions</a><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255); font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;" href="https://richardyanowitz.com/costa%20rica%20feb%206-8.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></a><a style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;" href="https://richardyanowitz.com/costa%20rica%20feb%2006-8.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></a><a style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;" href="costaricafeb03-5.html">Feb

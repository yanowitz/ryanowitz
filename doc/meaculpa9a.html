<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">For
a long time I found it difficult to find a term with which to address my
father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He never called me anything but
Son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It choked me to say Dad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the table I would direct my voice
directly at him and try to catch him looking towards me when I spoke to
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes my, "Pass the
potatoes," would be rather loud and startling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I finally succumbed, with some rationalization that
semi-satisfied me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think he was
stunned the first time I used it.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Jean
was easier; I called her by name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
was a problem when people commented on how young my mother looked and I would
have to say she was my stepmother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
embarrassed her and it embarrassed me also.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I never could say she was my mother, though.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Mink
had a bit of trouble adjusting to the Southern school she attended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She only had one friend and was generally
lonely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think she was happy when the
gift shop was closed because of poor business, and Dad decided he would go back
to work in fur.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jean and he went back
to Brooklyn and lived with her parents, Mink went to live with Flo, I moved in
with Hy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dad had gotten Hy a fur
floorboy job earlier in the year through his union connections, and he
succeeded in getting me one, too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
can't remember what time of the year it was, but I know I went to Washington
Irving High School at night in order to try to get my diploma.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never made it.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
Furriers Union had been fighting for workers' benefits and progressive reforms
since its founding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were an
aggressive, democratic group, whose program happened to parallel that of the
Communist Party of the USA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hy had
always been more politically minded than I and subscribed to a thoroughgoing
radicalism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He found himself right at home
with their ideals.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
remember the speeches and entertainment that were given on trucks fitted as
stages on Seventh Avenue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember
roaring at the antics of Zero Mostel mimicking Hitler, using a comb for the
moustache, giving the flaccid bent arm "Heil!"; aping Mussolini:
pouter-pigeon chest, jutting chin, and straight-armed fascist salute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He accompanied the imitations with
calculatedly scurrilous remarks and acerbic songs that delineated their
characters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Zero was about twenty-five
then.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Hy
had always been interested in the movies, the theater, and acting and
actors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had filled notebooks with
pictures of stars and supporting players; anybody who ever appeared on the
screen interested him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once we were on
the sun roof in Steeplechase Park and Hy grabbed my arm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He pointed at a fellow who he said had
played the part of an elevator boy in some B-movie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went over to him, called him by name, and got into a long
conversation with him.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Hy
had joined the Furriers Dramatic Group which was directed by Jules Dassin, who
became a Hollywood director.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
directed <i>Zorba, the Greek</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
left and was replaced by some other future-famous director; it might have been
Josh Logan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I may be wrong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was another director who showed how to
break down an amateur actress's reticence when doing love scenes, by being
physical with her before the rehearsals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hy told me it worked.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">When
I joined , Lulla Adler, the niece of Stella and Luther Adler, was the
director.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She never became famous in
her own right, but she was a capable coach; and, while the entire group was not
talented, they were all spirited and eager to accept corrections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were young enough to believe we had a lot
to learn despite our obvious genius.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
first thing I saw the group do was a play about Limbo, where souls were held
while the decisions as to where to send them were made by the Judges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Souls of people who had died violently were
awaiting judgment: A lynched Negro, a murdered union organizer, a woman dead of
starvation, a young soldier, and others destroyed by a casually ruthless
society.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hy played the role of the
murdered union organizer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was agit
prop and it succeeded in stirring me to pity and anger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also stirred in me a desire to show how
good I could be in a field where I had shown talent since I'd first opened my
mouth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never could sing worth a damn,
though I tried, Lord knows, I tried, but when<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>it came to recitations, I had THE voice.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Lulla
supervised an acting class, giving us certain impromptu assignments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was told that I was returning home to ask
forgiveness of my mother for some horrible deed, and I threw myself into the
task with abandon; I shrieked and cried and moaned<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and thrashed about and still wonder if I made a damned fool of
myself, but it really felt good to let myself go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We did a lot of improvisations, where you literally devise your
own role and learn to respond to, rather than anticipate, your fellow actor's
moves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a marvelous mental chess
game and could be wonderfully creative, or mind-binding.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">It
was patently understood that we were a politically aware group and whatever we
did was meant to be entertaining, but entertaining with a purpose, like the
Chinese theater.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lulla knew most of the
literature of the proletariat that was available and had contacts with
unpublished progressive playwrights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was a great new world for me and I plunged in voraciously.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was a quick study, but quick as I was
there were members of the group who knew everyone else's part, including mine,
while I was still struggling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One thing
I developed was the shaky confidence of the budding genius; I knew I was better
than anyone else, but I was scared that I was worse than everyone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was always a certain sliver of
criticism in me that made less of other people's attempts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was ashamed of this attitude and fought a
losing battle to convince myself it wasn't just envy, but it clung. . . .and
still does.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I'd
accepted the responsibility for the condition of my life for a long, long
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't blame public officials
for the poverty of my family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
God's Will, though my mother did complain:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Oy, Gott, fahr vuss hust doo oonz geshtrufen?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Alderman in our district used to line up
the kids and take them to the Loew's Commodore some mornings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was real nice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Jewish Social Service gave us food and clothing, sent me to
Camps Vacamas and Surprise Lake for two weeks of heaven in the summertime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Hebrew School didn't charge my mother
for the education and the Bar Mitzvah lessons; the day nursery was free for us
to attend while my mother worked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
got free breakfasts, had a place to play, so how was I to criticize anybody?</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
flag salute, "The Star Spangled Banner," and the study of American
History had made me a Statue of Liberty patriot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would sing "America the Beautiful" with a passionate
vision of the loveliest land in the world, endowed with the greatest virtues
mankind could revere&#8211;Liberty, Freedom, Brotherhood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, as time passed, a Canker Worm started gnawing at my
vitals as I lifted my eyes and mind to what was going on in the land I
loved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I realized that what I loved
about America was its Promise, not its actuality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was never dreamed of by the practical Founding Fathers as
Utopia, but the Constitution and the Bill of Rights were meant to give all the
people a chance to pursue happiness, not just an elite.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
started to resent poverty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd been
slammed around by it all my life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
kept checking all the clever phrases that kept me in bondage, and started
recognizing they were just advertising slogans meant to sell a product that had
many, many flaws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an Equal Society,
I was a member of the Lower Class.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
had been unhappily aware that Jews were kicked about and made to feel inferior
not only in Nazi Germany, but here in my beloved country; and I'd lived down
South and found that slavery still existed in many subtle forms.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
had long bull sessions with Hy, who tried to explain why he'd become a member
of the Young Communist League.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
was plenty to criticize that I hadn't been aware of, probably because my
interests lay with Nature and the wonders in ponds and streams.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was too busy dreaming to pay attention to
the unnatural world.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I started to nod
my head to his arguments.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Sammy's
father was a short, thin, stooped, dahvening Orthodox Jew.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My Rabbi in Cheyder had told us that one of
the long-lived patriarchs had donated seventy of the years of his life so that
King David could be born and live for seventy years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>David knew about this and as his doomday approached, this wise
son of Solomon decided he would defeat his destiny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He knew that he couldn't die while he was dahvening, because the
Angel of Death had to be seen before death and couldn't interrupt a man who was
praying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So he dahvened, and lived a
short time longer until the Angel fooled him into looking out the window to see
who was shaking his fruit tree.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
never saw Sammy's father without a Bible in his hands, his mouth in constant
movement, intoning the holy words.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
knew he had to stop when he went to the john, but he strove to be a holy man,
and Sammy had been trained to be like him. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>He'd argue with me about Communism and Atheism, and point out
articles in the newspapers that proved conclusively that The Soviet Union was
an evil place led by evil men who intended to spread their evil throughout the
world.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ridiculed his newspaper data
and showed him articles from the Daily Worker which proved that the truth about
the U.S.S.R. was never going to come from American newspapers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our army had fought against the funding of
the U.S.S.R. and the vendetta begun then would never end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Distrust them and distrust any of their
ideas!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was the guiding motif
behind our dealings with the Communists.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Sammy
had offered me a cup of tea while we were arguing amicable over our
beliefs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he gave me a tea bag to
dunk in my hot water, he laughingly made an excuse for the tea's lack of
color.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The poverty in his household did
not allow for the luxury of a new tea bag until no vestige of color dissolved
in the hot water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I laughed with him at
his father's stinginess and only realized later what a sad joke it was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hy's arguments, based on logic, were more
convincing than emotional, religious, pie-in-the-sky theories.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Believing what I did, and wanting to learn
more, I became a member of the Young Communist League.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
was a pretty good floorboy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It didn't
strain my brain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You had to work fast,
you had to carry heavy, wide, nailing boards, and you had to be at the beck and
call of the busy operators, cutters, and nailers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I worked for a boss who was very strongly anti-union and
anti-communist, but I felt American enough to believe in my constitutional
right, my constitutional obligation not to hide the fact that I was a
YCLer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was an important
demonstration I'd been asked to attend, and I asked the boss to let me off a
half hour early.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Naturally, he wanted
to know why.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He looked at me for a long moment, shook his
head, and said, "All right, but you'll have to make it up."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
made it up the next evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From then
on, he would dig at me, and not so subtly either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whenever he wanted me, he would call, "Communist" do
this, do that, and I started to understand how naive I'd been.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few days later he gave me the real haw-haw
when I had my pocket picked in a bus.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"You see," he said.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"You see?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It serves you
right!"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't see the
connection, but I didn't argue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
happy to lay me off a couple of days before Christmas when the Season ended.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
money dribbled out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Christmas had cost
Hy his job also, and he was staying at Ruthie's house while the family was away
on vacation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He suggested I move in
with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a double bed in the
front room that we could use.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
apartment was on the first floor and had two windows which led out to the fire-escape.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
got a one-night job through the State Employment Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I hadn't had any experience sleeping in the
afternoon, so I didn't even try to sleep before I got there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I started at nine p.m.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had to move barrels of limes and repack
them in boxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a pleasure to be
immersed in the lime odors, but the barrels were heavy, my energy level was
low, and I was tres happy when quitting time came at five a.m.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was disappointed to find that another
hiree had been given a full-time temporary job on the basis of his work.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">When
I got to the house, I dragged myself upstairs and pressed the buzzer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got no response.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tried again and again, and nothing happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wondered if Hy was home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I became more and more frustrated, finally
left the building, looked around to see if anyone was on the block who would
notice anything, climbed up on the stoop, jumped for the lowest rung on the
ladder hanging from the fire-escape, dangled a few moments, chinned and
wrenched and wriggled until I maneuvered my body up far enough to rest my knees
on the lowest rung, and finally felt strong enough to climb onto the
fire-escape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It made me furious to look
through the window and see Hy sleeping peacefully, oblivious even when I
pounded on the window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could have
murdered him with ease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Luckily for me,
and probably for him also, the window was not locked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I opened it, stepped down into the room, undressed and collapsed
into bed.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Even
one-night jobs were non-existent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
hated to borrow and promise to pay back without really believing I ever would
be able to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had been bitten by
a bug of pride; I guess it came from the Merriwell stories, and the Horatio
Alger "Rags to Riches" books.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With a background like that, how could I possibly sponge!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A hero out of my books could never become a
beggar!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Oh, I'd been part of a family
that was accepting charity, but that seemed different.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was hungry all the time, and I ceased to
feel welcome at Aunt Mae's house, though I may have been hypersensitive because
Hy was never bothered.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
canvassed the employment agencies on Sixth Avenue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't "even" have the experience to be that lowest
of all low&#8211;a dishwasher.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can't
remember where I got the nickels and dimes I used for carfare and food.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You could buy a hot dog or a knish for a
nickel and they threw in a large mug of root beer at many of the stands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even nickels disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was lucky I'd learned to sneak into a
subway exit through some bent revolving door bars, or I would have had to walk
enormous distances.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Fate
intervened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd become superstitious
about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I discovered that the Jewish
Agricultural Society was placing young fellows on farms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was something that was me!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be like living in Van Cortlandt
Park!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had always loved living
creatures, the outdoors, plants, animals; it couldn't miss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sure enough, when I applied, I was given a
job on a twenty-five hundred bird chicken farm outside of Middleboro,
Massachusetts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My salary was thirty
dollars a month, plus room and board.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Perhaps not "Riches," but away from "Rags."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Trains
were slow in '38.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Four hundred and
fifty miles took close to nine hours and I had had to catch an evening train,
and I never learned to sleep on trains.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I arrived in an exhausted condition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The farmer met me at the station in Boston and drove us the forty-odd
miles to the chicken farm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
hungry, but more than being hungry, I was sleepy; and the owner, a man of about
forty, plagued me with questions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As he
rattled on I found myself dozing, shaking myself, responding stupidly to past
questions and ignoring present ones.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
must have appeared surly, but I think he finally realized my condition; and
when we got to the farm, he asked me if I wanted to sleep a while.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I admitted I could use a little rest before
I got started.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I napped for a couple of
hours ad felt somewhat refreshed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
had allotted me a tiny room:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the bed
was comfortable enough, there was a small chest of drawers and a clothes
tree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My bedroom door opened on the
kitchen; and when I came out, my boss greeted me, had me sit at the table, and
fed me a fried chicken that had been alive half-an-hour earlier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was delicious!</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">With
a halfway alert mind it didn't take long to learn the chores I was to do
daily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had to feed, water, collect
the eggs twice a day, clean the dropping boards, chop the heads off chickens
and dry pluck them, and take care of any problems that came up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I used buckets on a wheelbarrow for the mash
and scratch, lugged buckets of water up hill and down dale to those insatiable
creatures, and developed muscles along the way.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I'm
chagrined that I've forgotten their names.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The farmer&#8211;I guess with me there he was more of a record keeper&#8211;was a
nice man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He warned me early-on that
what was my apparently perfect bite could bring me grief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He opened his mouth and showed me some of my
future nightmares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had had a set of
beautiful teeth and a perfect bite.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Over the years ordinary chewing had ground down his teeth until only a
narrow ridge of what had once been full grown teeth showed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He gave me his medical opinion that I would
have the same ground-down pulps when I reached his age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps it was vanity that scared me, but I
was scared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I only stopped worrying
when I reached his age.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">His
cheerful, smiling wife was rotund to softness, and a very pleasant, motherly
woman, who fed me well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His daughter
Ruth was just about the right age for me; she was attractive, but we didn't
mesh.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a twelve-year-old son,
an open friendly kid, with whom I got along well, and there was a delightful
goat that followed me wherever I went and dropped his black, pea-sized defecations
merrily as we did my chores.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was a
really pleasant companion.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">A
friend of the family came to visit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
was a real five-by-five by thirty-five-plus.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was embarrassed by her a number of times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She'd insist on dancing with me to victrola music and advertently
rub up against me in what she undoubtedly felt was a provocative manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We sat in the back seat of the car while the
farmer drove and his wife sat next to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whatever remarks they were making were vulgar or lewd, but I couldn't
follow them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They ragged her to death
after the ride.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had an uproarious
time doing it.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
had a grand opportunity to let my feelings of inferiority mushroom while
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ruth's friends were college
students, and one night she invited a number of them to a barbecue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wasn't uninvited, but I felt out of place
and retired early.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tried to read, but
the sounds of young voices, girlish giggles, music, merriment, kept me from
making sense of what I was reading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
couldn't take it anymore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I re-dressed,
but didn't have the guts to walk out into the kitchen, so I climbed out of my
window, which was on the dark side of the house, and skulked around a chicken
coop so that I would appear to be coming from elsewhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It didn't seem to make any impression on
anybody, anyway; they were having too good a time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eyes just slipped past me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I felt the fool.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Ruth's
father and mother arranged for me to accompany their daughter and some pairs of
her friends to some sort of entertainment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We were all dressed up; the car was crowded and somebody had to sit on
somebody's lap, and Ruth sat on mine.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was a very, very pleasant experience, but it had been thrust upon me
from the blue, so to speak, and I acted the fool by enjoying the contact, but
sitting like a statue&#8211;not even daring a shoulder&#8211;She was pretty. . . .</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
wrote letters to Sinki while I was there and enclosed small money orders for
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't remember her writing back,
but I think she must have.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This whole
time period is difficult for me to trace.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I loved the country and liked the chickens and the food and the family,
but I didn't like being a hired hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
felt inferior and I didn't want to stay that way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The family seemed unhappy to see me go, but wished me well.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">There
was one farewell that left me high and dry.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I had arranged to leave the next morning and was just entering my room
when Ruthie stopped me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The kitchen was
empty and she asked me to sit down across from her at the table.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Now
don't get all hot and bothered."&#8211;I think that's a direct quote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rest is not exact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"When you first came here, I died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt so lucky that someone like you was
coming into my life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You acted so cold,
I just didn't know what to do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I gave
you a thousand opportunities to just be nice, to just be warm, and you were a cold
fish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't let you go away
without letting you know.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Goodby."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She left the
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I sat staring after her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I finally got up and went to bed.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Oh,
the lips I might have tasted. . . .</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Hy
had a job in fur again and I moved in with him in a room in a brownstone on
Twenty-Seventh Street near Ninth Avenue.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I got a job as a floorboy soon after, and we both went back to the
dramatic group.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lulla had decided to do
Gerhard Hauptmann's strong labor play <i>The Weavers</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a young and pretty blonde girl
that I had a scene with, and she kind of invited herself up to my room to
rehearse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That's what we did, that's
all we did, and I walked her to the subway.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Hy
made a contact with a group that was putting on an American History Pageant at
Madison Square Garden and he suggested I come up and maybe I'd get a role.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The central character was Joe Worker, who,
through intolerable situations, struggled, fought against the enemies of The
Working Class and, though not victorious, never gave up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It started with the American Revolution,
quoted Tom Paine, touched on the Alien and Sedition Acts, Samuel Adams' radical
ideas, Franklin, Jefferson, and went on through 1812 and the War to Free the
Slaves, and into the Twentieth Century until 1939.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">They
had already cast Joe Worker, but the director gave me a shot at it and thought
I fit the bill as a young American working man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were 22,000 people in the audience, and I still remember
the hush as the light went out and the music for <i>Ballad for Americans</i>
started and Paul Robeson's voice, magnified a thousand times, rang out with the
first few lines and, as the lights came up slowly, and the echoes of that
magnificent baritone faded slowly, I was alone on the stage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A giant spot hit me, I raised my prop, which
was just a chair, and began the show.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">None
of us on stage could be heard, no matter how loudly we spoke.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maybe the first row in the audience could
hear our shouts, but the amplified sound levels of the mikes in the sound booth
drowned us out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Professional radiomen
and women, cast in our roles, recited our lines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their voices became our voices as we got caught up in the
dramatic combination of audience, action, lights, applause, vastness, and human
unity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vibes were right; we were
attuned to one another like an enormous congregation proud of a miraculous
asseveration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were sure of our
beliefs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our cause was just!</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I've
never duplicated that experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
think it needed innocence as the spice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Still, I learned to love beauty even when I discovered its warts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I learned to concentrate on the loving
aspects in humans rather than the flaws; but eventually I could only do that in
fantasy, on stage.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-style: italic;">First drafted June 2, 2004</p><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><p class="MsoNormal" style="">My earliest memories are things
I&#8217;ve been told, not images in my mind.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Mother tells me that shortly after I was born she stared at
me and started crying; she was seeing me grow up and leave the nest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On Mother&#8217;s Day 2004 I met her and Judi,
Alan, Sol and Richard for brunch on the upper West Side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Afterwards Mother and Judi and Alan and I
sat in a playground just inside the 81<sup>st</sup> St. entrance to Central
Park.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At one point I referred to this
tale of when I was a few days old, and Mother had tears in her eyes&#8212;I&#8217;m not
sure whether from the memory of the moment or something current.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly for many years (decades?) she has
regularly expressed guilt about what kind of mother she was.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I am told that in one New York apartment we lived a few
floors up and one day I climbed onto the window ledge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think Mimi was there at the time.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My father was draft-deferred because of me; fathers had
deferments until late in the war.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
something like Feb. 1945 he was in basic training in Georgia, and my mother took
my sister and me to live near the base (Ft. Benning, I think).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t know if Dad was able to live at
&#8220;home&#8221; with us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;d have been three and
Judi 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think we were there several
months before he shipped out, after which we returned to Manhattan, and lived
in a Village or Lower East Side apartment with Dad&#8217;s sister, Mildred, whom much
of the family called Millie but I always thought of as Mimi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have the sense that at least while I was a
child there was a special bond between Mimi and me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have a memory of my father later telling me that he was on the
Pacific heading for Japan when Truman dropped the A-bombs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He ended up being part of the occupying army
in the Philippines.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My sense is that my father returned home 18 months or so
later, and I have long imagined that I had changed in ways he didn&#8217;t like&#8212;that
this was the start of his rearing me with disapproval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or maybe it was when I was 2 and began
saying &#8220;no&#8221; (which would be before he went into the Army); within recent months
when I said something like that Mother said wistfully that he wasn&#8217;t angry with
me but couldn't handle hearing &#8220;no&#8221; in general.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This comment makes me think that I&#8217;m right to think he turned
against me when I began diverging from his image of what I should be.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Not too long after he returned from the army&#8212;several
months?&#8212;he used the GI Bill to buy a chicken farm in South Jersey.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As an adult when I tell this story I always
say wryly, &#8220;Some men went to college, some men bought homes&#8212;my father started a
chicken farm.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have almost
universally hateful memories of the farm&#8212;actually, 2 farms at different
times&#8212;but as an adult, especially once I was clearly going to be well educated,
I have taken a perverse pride in letting people know that I grew up on a
chicken farm; I often refer to myself as a peasant in origin; I shall press
myself to remember pleasant occurrences as I write.<span style="">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">I have a memory</span>&#8212;<span style="">I'm not sure it's direct, much less acurate</span>&#8212;<span style="">of driving to
the farm from New York City with a dog in the car that threw up during
the trip (which would have taken perhaps 2-3 hours on 1946 roads).
&nbsp;The following description of our first farm is impressionistic,
but I will look for&nbsp;photos to clarify what life on the farm was
actually like. &nbsp;The farmhouse was clapboard.. &nbsp;The chicken coop(s) (I 'm not sure if we had just one)
held 3500 birds (the same as our second farm) had tarpaper roofing.
&nbsp;I have the image of a few acres of property. &nbsp;We stayed on
this farm about five years. &nbsp;Local board of education rules would
not let me&nbsp;start kindergarten until I was 5 1/2; my girthday fell
after the cutoff date for entry at age four. &nbsp;My parents lobbied
to get me into school anyway when I was 4 1/2, but to no avail. &nbsp;I
attended school here through third grade before we moved. </span></p>

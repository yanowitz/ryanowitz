<p>I
barely knew him but I was extremely fond of my uncle Hy
(1915-1968),&nbsp;my father's elder brother, who became almost a
life-long communist in his teens. &nbsp;He spoke out
against&nbsp;injustice he detected of any kind and,
like&nbsp;many of
his
generation, believed that some form of communism was the best path to
justice for all people. &nbsp;I admired him and had many similar
political views, but even in my early 20s when I met him in Paris I was
put off
by some of his justifications of party behavior. &nbsp;I stayed
with
him, Mathilde and Henry in 1965 for a few months and happened to be
living in
Paris when Hy died in the fall of 1968.</p>
<p>When
World War II broke out in Europe a week after the Nazi-Soviet pact and
the US Communist
Party followed the Soviet line that the war was a
bourgois,&nbsp;capitalist affair, and so a
plague on all their houses, Hy vehemently opposed US entry
into&nbsp;the war. &nbsp;On June 22, 1941, the Nazis invaded
the Soviet
Union, and
the next morning a comrade was pounding on Hy's door in Manhattan,
shouting to him that the local party had to join the new effort to get
the US into the war to support the threatened socialist homeland.
&nbsp;Hy told me&nbsp;that he could not make such a rapid
U-turn, and I
suspect this was the first kernel of his eventual disillusionment with
the USSR, though
not with some&nbsp;idealized version of communism that he seemed
always
to&nbsp;carry in his head. &nbsp;I think he was a Stalinist
well into
the '50s and probably '60s. &nbsp;In&nbsp;<a href="familyhyletters.html#hy_letter_to_ed_approx1964">an
undated letter to my father</a>, probably written in the early
sixties, he echoes
familiar party-line rationales for staying with the party through thick
or thin&nbsp;and&nbsp;(a) defends Stalin as genuinely wishing
"to bring
about a solid basic socialism in the Soviet Union," while (b)
condemning his own&nbsp;weakness in, had he known Stalin's full
plans,&nbsp;having likely been
unable to support them.<a href="familyhy.html#hy_note1" name="hy_note1_source"></a><a href="familyhy.html#hy_note1">(1)</a></p>
<p>Once he decided that the US <span style="font-style: italic;">should </span>enter
the
war, Hy tried to join the army to fight
Hitler and anti-semitism but failed the physical because of flat feet.
Eventually he
wangled his way into the Red Cross and did spend the later part of the
war in Europe in the ambulance corps. &nbsp;He told me that many US
soldiers he encountered were on the wrong side (i.e., they
were&nbsp;anti-semitic), and that while in the European theater he
toted with him everywhere a large and heavy volume of poetry
(presumably English
and
American). &nbsp;</p>
<p>After
the war Hy was in Paris
and&nbsp;met my Aunt Mathilde (Mahty for short), a
smart,&nbsp;assertive and apparently stunning woman from Tunisia.
&nbsp;(She still looks good in her 80s.) &nbsp;They
had one son, Jai<a href="familyhy.html#hy_note2new_source" name="hy_note2new_source"></a><a href="familyhy.html#hy_note2">(2)</a>,
while living in
Paris. &nbsp;In 1948 the family moved
to a chicken farm near us in South Jersey: Hy came to work for the
presidential candidacy of the Progressive Party's Henry Wallace, FDR's
third vice-president.&nbsp;His other son, Henry, was born in Somers
Point, NJ, in 1949. &nbsp;There is a story that when Hy went with a
black chicken-farming friend, Jimmy Wilson, to a local bar and the bar
refused to serve Jimmy, Hy smashed a bar glass and stalked out.
&nbsp;I
think the glass was served to him empty; I also suspect the two of them
deliberately went to this bar to challenge its segregation.
&nbsp;(Where we all lived in South Jersey was putatively south of
the
Mason-Dixon line.)</p>
<p>In
1950 Hy and his family returned to Paris.
&nbsp;They lived first at 22 rue des Amandier. &nbsp;In 1954
they found a small apartment in the 20th arrondissement, a
working-class district in which Hy may have been the only resident
American and the only person daily to order the
international&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Herald&nbsp;Tribune
</span>(along with <span style="font-style: italic;">Le
Monde</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">l'Humanite</span>,
the communist paper) from the local newdealer. &nbsp;They had to
pay "under the table," as Hy put it, many
hundreds (800?) of dollars to obtain their extremely cheap, run-down
(though charming to my eyes) rental that was finally torn down long
after Hy died; in 1989, the government rehoused Mathilde&nbsp;in a
newly built apartment project
in the rue St. Blaise, elsewhere in the 20th, where she lives today.
&nbsp;Moving left to right in the apartment when you
entered the front door, with rooms side by side: a bathroom (at first
just toilet and sink), the parents' bedroom, a somewhat narrow and
slightly elongated living room, a very narrow kitchen, and Jai's
bedroom, which I shared with him.
&nbsp;Henry had a small loft above and at the
rear of the living room, though I don't know at what point that was
built. &nbsp;Initially, the apartment had no bathing facility, and
the
family would, like many Parisians in the area (and perhaps elsewhere in
the city?) traipse a block or two to public baths which still existed
through the 1960s. &nbsp;At some point, probably in the 50s (and,
thank
goodness, before my 1965 stay there), they had a shower installed.
&nbsp;I
have an image of a full body-length shower, but perhaps it was the more
traditional continental one I've often seen of a tub with a hand shower.</p>
<p>At some point after that, probably during the McCarthy
years, the
US would not issue him a passport because of his politics (or maybe
refusal to sign an oath required for a passport). &nbsp;When Paul
Robeson won a Supreme Court case to regain his passport (which the
State Department had revoked&nbsp;in 1950), Hy (and others) was
able to
get one again. &nbsp;At least once, sometime in the
1960s, he returned to the US to visit family, accompanied by Henry, his
younger son. &nbsp;In about 1963, his elder son, Jai, was jailed in
Tunisia (for being French?), and Hy got the American embassy to arrange
for Jai's release as an American citizen.<a href="familyhy.html#hy_note2">(3)</a><a name="hy_note2_source"></a> &nbsp;Both his sons
have dual
citizenship and probably retain and can travel on US passports (which I
think they use only to visit the US) to this day.</p>
<p>During
the US war in Vietnam, Hy started a peace group called PACS
(Paris-American Committee to Stopwar) which, when I was there, seemed to draw
especially on Americans well to the left. &nbsp;For a long time he
and
Mathilde (though I suspect this was Hy's initiative) had their own
version of a salon, with people welcome to drop by on Sunday
afternoons. &nbsp;I particularly remember the political
discussions/arguments/harangues, and especially one about the "correct"
left-wing leadership of Algeria--Ben Bella (the incumbent radical) or
Boumedienne (the more radical). &nbsp;Nothing on the left (and
perhaps
in all political stripes) stirs passion quite so much&nbsp;as
doctrinaire hair-splitting among those whose political convictions
almost agree. &nbsp;Conversation was often in English, although I
could
speak decent (certainly not fluent nor argot-rich) French when I was
there, and I remember feeling both welcome by Hy's guests and treated a
bit condescendingly as at least young and perhaps American.
&nbsp;That
I was a leftist was to them, however, I think, a welcome relief from
more mainstream American tourists who passed through. [Henry: The
"Sunday evening" at Hy's included political discussions&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">but also cultural</span>. During these hours, for example, visitors might take up the
latest Antonioni film.".<a href="familyhy.html#hy_note3" name="hy_note3_source"></a><a href="familyhy.html#hy_note3">(4)</a>]</p>
<p>When I
knew him, he seemed generous and kind to&nbsp;everyone, but (I
learned from others) like too many of us was
less successful in his
family life. &nbsp;He
and Mahty never had much money (though the cheap apartment helped them
get by, I gathered).&nbsp; [Henry: My father was a great feminist,
not only intellectually but in his daily behavior (housekeeping,
dishwashing). &nbsp;He always encouraged his wife to blossom in all
ways.<a name="hy_note4_source"></a><a href="familyhy.html#hy_note4">(5)</a>] American
tourists would often stop in,
having been urged to do so by mutual friends, and Hy always seemed
welcoming. &nbsp;(I have sometimes wondered how this openness sat
with Mathilde. &nbsp;[Henry: My mother was never reluctant about
visits from all these strangers.<big><font style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;" color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2"><big><a href="familyhy.html#hy_note5">(6)</a><a name="hy_note5_source"></a></big></font></big>])&nbsp;
Mahty had 9 or 10 siblings, many of whom gradually came to live in
Paris, and Hy, I understood, often helped them out financially and
socially.
&nbsp;He was quite generous when I stayed there in 1965, and showed
me
all over the city. &nbsp;For Canadian television, in the late 1950s
or
early 60s, he helped write and/or produce&nbsp;a multi-part TV
series<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>, <a href="http://www.tvarchive.ca/database/19304/mademoiselle_de_paris/details/"><span style="font-style: italic;">Mademoiselle de Paris</span></a>,
and he seemed to know every nook and cranny of the city, taking me into
courtyards and alleys that I would never find on my own. Somewhere in
my files I may still have the brochure he gave me about the series.
&nbsp;(The web site I reference here lists only 7 episodes, but I
think there were many more.)</p>
<p>During
my stay in 1965, the family tried to set me up with a niece on Mahty's
side. &nbsp;Annie and I did go out once, and we agreed on what the
family was up to. &nbsp;We also agreed we would not yield to this
pressure. &nbsp;Annie and I have remained friends over the years; I
think of her as a cousin, and when Maxine and I were in Paris during
our <a href="honeymooninburgundy.html">honeymoon in 2005</a>,
we stayed with her, and she treated
us&nbsp;regally.</p>
<p>Like so many&nbsp;Yanowitzes Hy wanted to be an
actor and had
strong feelings about what constituted good and bad acting.
&nbsp;He loved
musicals. &nbsp;In Paris, he became a writer of English subtitles
(including, I believe, for <span style="font-style: italic;">Shoot
the Piano Player</span>) and
dubbing dialogue (while I was living in Paris, he directed the dubbing
of a recent Soviet film--"T-34" as&nbsp;the dubbed version was
called, but I cannot find an internet refrence, so perhaps it is known
under a different name--set in WWII and had me do some of the
voice-over). &nbsp; [Henry:&nbsp;My father played in <a href="familyhyfilms.html">a series of films</a>
(like&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">Le fauve
est&nbsp;</span><big><font style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;" color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2"><big><span style="font-style: italic;">lâché</span>); you don't
bring out this important side of his life.<a name="hy_note6_source"></a><a href="familyhy.html#hy_note6">(7)]</a></big></font></big></p><p>Two
communist
party actions in 1968, I think, sapped much of Hy's will to live and
took away any remaining loyalty to any communist party, though not to
his ideals. &nbsp;The first was the French Party's betrayal of the
French uprisings, spearheaded by students in Paris, in May-June.
&nbsp;The second&nbsp;was the August Soviet invasion of
Czechoslavakia
to put down the Dubcek regime; Hy
thought that regime was creating the ideal state for which he had
waited all his life. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Those events did not help the serious heart problem Hy developed in the last
year or so of his life. &nbsp;People would try to get him
to eat better, and he would say that if he couldn't live and enjoy
eating (especially in Paris restaurants), it wasn't worth living.
&nbsp;Towards the end, as he lay in bed in the family's
apartment, very weak, Mathilde kept urging&nbsp;people to talk
softly so he would have as much calm as possible; she was terrified
that getting upset would kill him. &nbsp;The apartment
building and others formed a small courtyard, where one of those
afternoons a
fight broke out. Two&nbsp;North African men were shouting, and at
least one had a knife. &nbsp;Mathilde became frantic at not being
able to control
the situation and phoned the police. &nbsp;The cop who answered
asked, "Are
they North African?" and she had to stammer, "No, no"; they wouldn't
have come otherwise. &nbsp;My memory pictures Jai running into the
courtyard
and somehow breaking up the fight.</p>
<p>Soon after that Hy was removed
to a hospital, and as the story went, he died in the middle of the
night while trying
to ring for a nurse; supposedly he was found dead partway out of bed as
if he had started to crawl for help.<big><font style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;" color="#000000" face="Arial" size="2"><big><a name="hy_note7_source"></a><a href="familyhy.html#hy_note7">(8)</a></big></font></big></p>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><a name="hy_note1"></a><a href="familyhy.html#hy_note1_source">(1)</a> I suspect it goes with
the leftist
territory to flay oneself for not being pure enough to support and
perform&nbsp;acts that repulse one--such guilt was certainly
encouraged when I was a
young activist, and it has never entirely left me (as in, "What right
do I have to enjoy myself&nbsp;while injustice and poverty rage all around me?").
&nbsp;&nbsp;One probably imbibes such thinking early on,
starting with parental chastisment for malfeasances such as not eating
one's vegetables when people are starving in [your image here of a
particularly impoverished location--in my childhood it was China, as I
recall, but it could as easily have been India or generic Africa or
sharecroppers].&nbsp; My father was fond of a saying I still find
salutary and solacing when I feel sorry for myself: "I cried because I
had no shoes until I met a man who had no feet."&nbsp; (I am
blurring two related but not identical weaknesses--guilt at not living
up to one's image of one's own ideals, not
being politically pure enough (a version of what Tom Wolfe described
in&nbsp;"Mau-mauing the Flak-Catchers"), versus guilt over imagined
narcissism, not deserving to be happy.) &nbsp;&nbsp;I once had
a gentle Marxist friend who proposed that because executing
anyone in furtherance of the revolution was so terrible but also in
some cases so necessary, the revolutionary comrade <span style="font-style: italic;">least&nbsp;</span>eager
to do so should be chosen--not as punishment, but to purify the act and
minimize enabling violent tendencies in more ruthless comrades.</p>
<p><a name="hy_note2new"></a><a href="familyhy.html#hy_note2new_source">(2)</a> Jai
tells the following story about the origin of his name(s): "The 'story'
of my birth name (please sit comfortably in an
armchair...) : When I was born in the American Hospital of
Neuilly-sur-Seine (excusez du peu!--"see how privileged I am!") my mother and father decided to
call me Robert (after the son of a friend who was killed during
the war),&nbsp;Jai (after&nbsp;Joseph,&nbsp;my
grandfather's name, and&nbsp;<a href="meaculpa2.html#meaculpa2_irving_and_abie">Abraham
and Irving</a>--Millie's twin--the names of&nbsp;our fathers'
brothers
who died in the thirties--<a href="meaculpa5.html#meaculpa5_irving_death">Irving</a>&nbsp;November
14, 1935, <a href="meaculpa5.html#meaculpa5_abie_death">Abie</a>
June 9, l936). &nbsp;Freud would say it was already quite a heavy
burden
to carry, but the story is not finished.... &nbsp;At the last
moment, as
my father was at a political meeting (!), my mother asked her brother
André (nicknamed 'Bébé') to go and register me at the town hall and to
add a Tunisian name in third position as a 'souvenir' [memory] of her
country.&nbsp; My uncle was a little 'étourdi (scatterbrained) and
declared: Youssef, Robert, Jai! &nbsp;As soon as my mother realized
the
error she tried to change it, but&nbsp;once registered, it was
impossible. &nbsp;So she
had to take a lawyer to try to delete 'Youssef.' and as the process
lasted too long and cost quite a lot she became on bad terms with the
lawyer and decided on her own to cross out 'Youssef' everywhere on
the papers. &nbsp;So for many years my first names where Robert
(for non-family) and Jai (for&nbsp;relatives). &nbsp;When I was
around 22 years
old I had to go before an Army Board (I was invalided out at last)
where
suddently a officer shouted very loudly to call me: Youssef Yanowitz!
&nbsp;So I really learned about the whole history then (I knew very
vaguely before)! But I also discovered that in 1948 a court had changed
'Youssef' had been changed to 'Joseph' but the lawyer never told my
mother because of their being on bad terms. &nbsp;So, as says
Molière, 'et voila pourquoi votre fille est
muette...' ('so there you have it: that should explain everything'), and
why your cousin has a problem of stability of personality."</p>
<p><a name="hy_note2"></a><a href="familyhy.html#hy_note2_source">(3)</a>&nbsp;I
originally remembered this about Algeria. &nbsp;Jai sent me the
following correction and commentary: "It was not in Algeria but in
Tunisia I was 'saved' by
my American passport during <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/bizerte-crisis">'les évènements de Bizerte.'</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;On that occasion I
understood
what&nbsp;"roll out the red carpet" means. &nbsp;I was really
stuck in Tunisia
with my French passport and suddenly with my American one all&nbsp;doors were open."

<p><a name="hy_note7"></a><a href="familyhy.html#hy_note7_source">(8)</a> Jai
comments that he remembers me angry at Hy's funeral because I was late.
&nbsp;My first wife, Sherrl and I, owned a Saab, and for some
reason, apparently I couldn't follow the hearse, which rushed to the
cemetery and left behind the cars trying to follow it. &nbsp;That
sounds vaguely familiar, but I was at the grave before the ceremony was over, because I have a vivid memory of watching the
starkly plain wood coffin being lowered into the ground. &nbsp;I
also remember a large gathering afterwards at Rue des Haies of family and friends.</p>
<p>After telling that story about my anger over being late to the funeral, Jai asks, "But why do I remember
you in angry situations?" &nbsp;In an earlier e-mail, he had
recalled an event of which I have some memory--that while staying at
Hy's in 1965, I was awakened at 7 or 8 am by noise from work (building
renovation) nearby (next door?), and I railed in angry at the injustice
of it. &nbsp;I remember that Hy had no sympathy for my anger and
assured me that this was an appropriate time for such activity.
&nbsp;I would answer Jai that he probably remembers my being angry
because I was too easily angry and feeling that the world was out to
get me--a topic I will be covering on this web site.</p>
<p>Jai also remembers a bit more of my 1965 visit: " I
remember how you changed between the first
time you came [1965] and the second time [1968]: the first time you
were quite
serious, you didn't like pop music, etc., etc. The second time you
played your guitar while singing Bob Dylan songs (from&nbsp;after his folk
period)
and told me how you appreciated some kind of cakes with 'special
things' in them." &nbsp;I have no memory of those cakes... </p>

usually verbatim, but I have grouped the narrative in broad topics,
have
stripped out speech superfluities like hesitations, and have
occasionally added
or changed one or a few words to make a passage work in context.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Mimi says &#8220;you,&#8221; of

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I talked to Ed about recording
these memoirs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
told him, &#8220;You know, there are certain
things you said in yours that I disagree with.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He said, &#8220;I know.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I took
certain privileges.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
his story, I
found some discrepancies&#8212;not a lot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I skip around a lot.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I do this normally, actually.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My
son goes crazy: &#8220;Ma, stay on the subject!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But that&#8217;s me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Lou and Irving were the brothers;
the sisters were Mae
and Rose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Oldest
was my father, I
think&#8212;no Rose was the oldest, and my father I think was next, then Aunt
Mae,
and Irving was the youngest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">My parents had six children&#8212;Hy, Ed,
Sylvia, Irving, me
and Abie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was a
twin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Irving was my
twin, and he died before he
was 12.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">My father deserted my mother when
we were infants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
think I was 3 years old at the time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We lived on the Lower East Side&#8212;no, on E. 4<sup>th</sup>
St. near 3<sup>rd</sup> Ave.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My father
felt he was too young when he got married.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He wanted to see other women, etc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">When I was a child, the farthest
back I can remember
was our living on 4<sup>th</sup> St. between 2<sup>nd</sup>
and 3<sup>rd</sup>
Ave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We may have
been somewhere else
before then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s a
walk-up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The toilet
was in the hall, shared with
other apartments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
had a bathtub in
the kitchen, with a lid on it, next to the sink.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You could wash dishes and put them on the lid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then you had to take
everything off to take
a bath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had
running hot water, but
we had no central heat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
had a
potbelly stove.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
winter, we&#8217;d stay in
the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
it was time to sleep,
you&#8217;d go to bed; it was cold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
we
moved, we lived on Eldridge St.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
had
a bathroom!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Big
thing!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Toilet, a
tub where my mother washed
clothes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother
was on welfare.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
also worked for awhile, as a sewing
operator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
earned something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
whenever she got sick, she would end up
going on welfare.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
got sick a lot;
she had TB.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That&#8217;s
why we ended up
finally in the orphanage, because there was no place else.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At times someone would
come in and stay with
us&#8212;when they knew she wouldn't get well.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I didn&#8217;t like food.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I remember sitting in the high chair, and my mother
would say, &#8220;Fress,
fress.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The first sound I ever heard from
my father was
banging on the door to try to get my mother to open it so he could come
in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was in this
drunken stupor, and
she wouldn&#8217;t let him in the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I
must have been very young, maybe less than 3.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I never remember my father hugging or kissing me or
taking me somewhere;
I remember my mother doing this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
I
don&#8217;t remember my father ever living with us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So it must have been at that point that once he came
home like that, she
was afraid to let him in, and that was the end of it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">He went away.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don&#8217;t remember exactly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I just
remember being frightened, and he was banging on the door trying to
come in and

Ed were there at

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I took a trip to Allentown,
Pennsylvania,
with my mother when I was very little.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I remember the train ride, and it was
wonderful&#8212;first time I was on the
train.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t know
how my mother did
it, but she took one of us at a time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I
think Eddie writes something about this, too.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Probably the oldest stayed home and took care of
the others.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Somehow
it worked out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
know I was the only one who went with
her&#8212;it&#8217;s not like you went with your brothers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">My grandmother lived there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was a little woman. </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">She wore a shaitl, a marriage wig.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was very religious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember her
going out to the back yard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
lived
over a shul.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
would sleep with her
because there was no real room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, you sleep with Bubbie because it&#8217;s
wonderful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
grandchildren think it&#8217;s the most
wonderful thing in the world, so I figure I probably did, too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t remember&#8212;I was 3
or 4 years
old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
affectionate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I don&#8217;t know if my grandfather

there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never

&#8220;I remember seeing my father kill chickens that way on the farm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He must have learned it
from seeing it
done.&#8221;]<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Well, he learned it because
he was a
farmer and he had to.&nbsp; He used to hang
them up by their feet and go bang-bang-bang.&nbsp;
One day I was on your farm and one of the chickens had pecked another
chicken, and it was dying.&nbsp; He had
taught me that if that happened you had to kill the chicken, so I had
to wring
its neck, which I just did because it had to die.&nbsp; These
things didn&#8217;t bother me.&nbsp;
I cleaned the chicken and it never bothered me; a lot of people
couldn't
stand to <i>clean
</i>a
chicken.&nbsp; Today you don&#8217;t have to; it all comes
eviscerated.</span><br>

think one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a
picture of my mother
sitting down, and your father mentions it, but I don&#8217;t have that
picture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I only
have the one of her with her hair
curled on the top of her head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
was
a very pretty woman, and my father was a very handsome man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Whoever I love becomes gorgeous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have pictures of Hy
where he was
good-looking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s
hard to believe,
because Hy was not good-looking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
I

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It was very common for families to
split
up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whole families.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You didn&#8217;t have a job, you
ran away from
responsibilities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
got married
because people came over from Europe, didn&#8217;t want to stay with their
spouse any
more, and left them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">My mother was Litvack, my father
was Galizianer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their
dialects of Yiddish were
different.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think
they met here in the
US.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">My mother, she came from

met here in the United States.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m
not
sure where.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He came
over when he was
about 6 years old, my father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
spoke
Yiddish as my first language; English was my second language.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t speak it any more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can understand a lot,

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I really don&#8217;t know their story,
how they
met.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother was
a beautiful looking
woman, and my father was a very handsome guy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But I never heard the story of how they got together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They came here at
different times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I don&#8217;t know any stories of what it
was

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I didn&#8217;t know my father the way
some people knew their
father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He wasn&#8217;t
around that
much.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Years later,
when I saw him with
you and Judi and David, he was very lovable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I don&#8217;t know how old my father
was&#8212;his birthdate is
probably on my birth certificate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">He would come to visit, and he&#8217;d
give my cousins $5
and $10&#8212;Aunt Mae&#8217;s children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
I&#8217;d
say to him, &#8220;I need money for stockings.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At that time you could get silk stockings for 50
cents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said, &#8220;I
gave you money last month.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I didn&#8217;t get the money; he would try to
show everybody he was such a big shot.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was always very, very good to my cousins.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They thought he was
wonderful.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I never liked my father.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I don&#8217;t know if my father hit us
kids.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was gone
before I could remember that
much.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He probably
did hit my brothers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Before he deserted the family, my

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Aunt Bertha was my mother&#8217;s
youngest
sister</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Everybody used to tell me that I was Aunt Bertha&#8217;s
favorite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
very sweet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
brought me an
outfit, a plaid skirt and a velvet blouse, which I loved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Until then I had very
little clothes except
the clothes from the home, and nobody worried about getting me any
clothes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It wasn&#8217;t
important.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
what goes on when you come out of a
home and you're the orphan in the family.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I had hand-me-downs, I think from Elsie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had an uncle who, when I
got older, would bring me fabric so I
could make myself some things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because
he worked for <i style="">[Oscar Renta?]</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Rentners that are now
called Oscar de la
Renta.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was their
cutter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Renta is a
relative of Uncle Dave&#8217;s, Aunt
Mae&#8217;s husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
the time it was Oscar
Renta, the father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now
it&#8217;s Oscar <i style="">de</i> la Renta, the son or
the son of the
son, for all I know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
don&#8217;t know how
old he is.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
all, I was a kid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Aunt Bertha died of blood poisoning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was sweet, but
she died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And Eddie
tells you that she
had been a very sick person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
got
blood poisoning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
was sewing, and she
got a needle in her finger, and they didn&#8217;t take good care of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She lived with my mother
in New York and she
got sick, and they didn&#8217;t do anything for her, and she died after that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Before that time she was living
with my
mother, with 6 kids at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
father wasn&#8217;t there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
she wasn&#8217;t
well enough to work most of the time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One night, as Eddie tells you in his, one of the gas
jets turned on by
accident, and we had gas coming through the whole apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(In those days we didn&#8217;t
have electricity;
we had gas.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
woke up to go to the
bathroom, and she fell down and realized something was wrong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So she woke us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The police came, and the
fire engines came.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
were in the newspapers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
once had our picture in the
newspaper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
probably the Daily
News.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was eleven,
ten, nine, born in
1923, and it was after the Depression started.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was due to her, my Aunt Bertha, that we&#8217;re still
alive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If she
hadn&#8217;t woken up, we&#8217;d be dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
was one person in the building who
died that day&#8212;Eddie&#8217;s tells about that.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I remember being in the newspaper, I remember being
rushed out of the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was a
little kid&#8212;I couldn't
have been more than 6 or 7 probably.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">My mother was a very sick woman&#8212;she
had TB, though I
don&#8217;t remember how young I was when she had it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I remember her taking me once to see her parents in
Pennsylvania,
and I remember going on the train.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You
know, there is no more train to Allentown.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Julius in Allentown was my mother&#8217;s
brother; he was
married to Aunt Sadie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
had a
grocery store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
had a daughter, no
other children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
doted on her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
far as I know, the daughter is still
alive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Julius
died, they got in
touch with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
died in Allentown but
was buried in Queens somewhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
last
saw Sadie and her daughter when I was married to Leo.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My mother had sisters: Aunt Helen, Aunt Bertha, Aunt
Sadie&#8212;not
Julius&#8217; wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
also had brothers,
but I can&#8217;t remember their names.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There
was an Uncle Joe, probably dead by now.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His son got in touch with us about five years ago
because he was
building a family tree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I

told him to
call Ed, who doesn&#8217;t remember this anymore, but they did talk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t remember his first
name&#8212;he was a
Greenberg, my mother&#8217;s maiden name.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">My mother&#8217;s side of the family was
estranged from my
father&#8217;s side, probably because he used to run around with other women.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Some family relations: Stevie is in
my family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From
Mae&#8217;s (Mary&#8217;s) family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
daughters are Ruth, Flo, Elsie, Harriet,
Sylvia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Ruth had Bunny, Francine, Merry and
Mike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are
people I lived with for
years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Flo had two
children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her son
died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Elsie had no
children.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Harriet had no children&#8212;she died from an overdose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Elsie was married to Miltie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she died, he married
his third cousin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Harriet
died; we used to call her Terry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sylvia&#8217;s
son, Butchie, was a very very
bright student.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
married young, and
he had 6 or 8 children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
wife died,
too&#8212;she had phlebitis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
don&#8217;t know his
children&#8217;s names.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
had twins,
too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of them
became pregnant and
had children before she was married.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One of his children was born the same day as his
grandchild.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s
like any family&#8212;they all have problems.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

two of us, Abe and
I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before that,
Eddie had taken us out
for the day, to see a movie or whatever.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My sister was with us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My sister
pulled me aside and said, &#8220;I will tell you something, but don&#8217;t tell
Eddie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he hears
I told you, he&#8217;ll
kill me.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I
said, &#8220;What?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
she said, &#8220;Irving died.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
she told me he died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was in shock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
didn&#8217;t cry out or anything.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Eddie brought us back to the home. I was 12 years
old&#8212;I had to keep my
mouth shut and not scream or cry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

passed out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think
I did that three times in my
life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I went on vacation, and when I came
back, I was looking for Abie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
couldn&#8217;t find him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
had gone to a camp for two weeks.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I&#8217;m looking for Abie, and nobody knows where
Abie is, and no one will tell me anything.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All of a sudden, I&#8217;m called to the office, and Hy is
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maybe it
wasn&#8217;t an office&#8212;it was one of the
school buildings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hy
tells me that Abie
and Mama died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ha!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I fainted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What I couldn&#8217;t do for my
brother...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had to
carry it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hy and
I were very close&#8212;Eddie was a little jealous, I think, of that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>At the time, yeah.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I didn&#8217;t feel
differently when my twin, Irving died, from when Abie died, because
they were
very very close, a year apart.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Abie
and
Irving were the best of friends, and I was the sister.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We were close.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Irving had more a special bond with Abie than with
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">My mother&#8217;s death.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That was a real tragedy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She had TB.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That&#8217;s why I ended up in the orphanage, because
there was no place else.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
times someone would come and stay with us
until they knew she wouldn't come home again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was no real treatment for tuberculosis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They kept putting her in
the hospital and they sent her to the
sanitarium.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
care, but I don&#8217;t
know if they gave her anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
don&#8217;t
know if they had anything in those days, like they have for asthma.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Nobody dies of asthma
today if it&#8217;s caught.
<span style="">&nbsp;</span>Because Iris
has asthma, and Sammy had,
and Rebecca had.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
has bronchial;
hers isn&#8217;t bad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Iris
is the worst.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
live normal lives.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I was in the home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I didn&#8217;t know too much about it, except what
my sister told me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
had gone to visit
her, and Irving was there at the time, and Abie.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I think it was at the beginning when she was in the
hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
that, they wouldn't let
us in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had all
visited her in this
great big room with a lot of other beds and people.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was very sad.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was
very sick.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">She would stay with us, period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And then, when they knew
she wouldn't get
well, they put us in the home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">When I was little, my friends and I
would play jacks,
or we&#8217;d jump rope.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
didn&#8217;t wander
very far.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You were
scared to go further
than your corner unless you were with some adult.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I went to school after my twin brother, because I
was in the
hospital when he started school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
had
St. Vitus&#8217; Dance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
would twitch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;ve
known people who had it all their
lives; I outgrew it&#8212;I was very lucky.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My hand might suddenly jerk; if that happened, I
would jerk on the other
side, too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think
my father yelled at
me and said, &#8220;Try not to do it!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
had
it for many years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
lost it after my
mother died.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I had friends, very close friends
at one point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
was Beatrice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
mother was alone, no husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
had a brother named Murray who finally became a doctor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Another friend, Lily, was very pretty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had a mother and
father at home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
was unusual compared to what I&#8217;d seen
around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn&#8217;t
know many people with
fathers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knew
them until I grew up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lily
moved to Brooklyn, near the beach.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We were kids.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
played dolls, and we played jacks, and we
played whatever little girls did.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Jump
rope.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No imaginary
friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We&#8217;d walk
down the block.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
never walked very far.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
walked from one corner to the
other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lily lived
on Second Ave., but
very close to 4<sup>th</sup> St., so we&#8217;d go there and come
back again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
lived on 4<sup>th</sup> St.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">My mother always wanted to do
something
for me, but she never really had money.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At that time Shirley Temple became very popular, and
all I wanted was a
Shirley Temple dress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
took her
dress that she had worn once, twice&#8212;a white dress.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She got some piping. Shirley Temple used to wear
this little white
dress with piping around it, red or blue.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Very fancy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
she made me
one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn&#8217;t see
the movie; I saw it
in pictures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
would see pictures all
over the place about Shirley Temple&#8212;very important.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I remember I was cold one day, and
my mother still had
a fur coat, seal skin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
father was a
furrier, so she probably had one from then.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And she had these big cuffs on it, and I would put
my hands in them to
keep warm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
never minded it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
don&#8217;t remember her too well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
only remember that she was a sweet person,
a very gentle person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
don&#8217;t remember
her ever hitting me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
kids&#8217;ll tell
you I hit them, but I don&#8217;t remember her ever laying a hand on me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">My mother was very poor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even when she worked she
didn&#8217;t make much
money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were six
kids.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Six
kids&#8212;whatever you make, it&#8217;s never going
to be enough.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
would buy a quarter
pound of chicken and this chicken she made soup out of, and then we&#8217;d
each have
a piece.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You know
what a quarter of a
chicken is?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like
the white meat with a
wing?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She&#8217;d share
it among us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">We&#8217;d have a pail to go down to get
our
milk or our cream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
were the days
you didn&#8217;t have deliveries, in glass bottles even.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Everything had to be siphoned out from a big
container.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
were quart buckets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
were made so you had a cover on them
and you could walk with them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or
you'd
get some sour cream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None
of the stores
would give you a container.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
had to
bring your own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then
you had an ice box
that you had to put it into.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
iceman
came.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For ten cents
you could get
ice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He came very
often because an ice
box doesn&#8217;t hold ice that long.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
don&#8217;t
know if it was every day or every other day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But I remember that we once forgot to change the pan
under the icebox,
and we had a flood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
had to take the
pan out and spill it out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">My mother kept kosher.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My aunt kept kosher
somewhat.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You couldn&#8217;t bring <i style="">tref</i>
in the
house, but she did mix dishes except on Passover.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She would kosher pots for Passover.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You put them in the oven til it gets very, very hot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then you have to put a
hot, hot stone in
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You get a stone
in the yard, wash
it, and put one in each pot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m
not
sure if you heat them separately.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It
could be that you just heat the stone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I used to think it was so funny.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She knew her kids ate bacon, but they had to eat it
outside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">When I lived with my mother, I was
very young and
didn&#8217;t do anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hy
and Eddie did
the koshering of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
had to
cover everything with white paper from the butcher, and we had separate
dishes
for milk and meat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
never kept kosher
for Passover.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once
I ate <i style="">tref</i>, I didn&#8217;t feel I needed
to be
kosher any more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
first time was
when my father took us to a Chinese restaurant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was living with Aunt Mae, after my mother died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was maybe 14.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Oh&#8212;I did eat shrimps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
used to go with Sylvia&#8217;s sister-in-law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We used to go to a Chinese restaurant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You know what it cost to have shrimps?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>25 cents, for a whole meal!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It&#8217;s
so hard to believe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
I was 16 I was
making $4 a week, so that was a lot of money.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Everything is relative.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At one
time you got around New York for a nickel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I never sneaked under turnstiles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was a very honest person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maybe it was common for
the boys to sneak
under.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Today girls
are more brazen in
what they&#8217;ll do and how they&#8217;ll carry on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I didn&#8217;t do naughty things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I went to work, I
would take off a day and go see plays&#8212;when
I was 16 or so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
I was younger, I
was too well-behaved, a goody-good.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Eddie scared me so once.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don&#8217;t
remember what it was, but I passed out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hy went to work.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Eddie was still
in school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hy would
get paid and pay my
mother money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
would give me a
dime&#8212;that was a lot of money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
could
buy so much candy for it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I adored Hy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ed was a lot of fun.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He used to
play games with us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
sister, Sylvia,
was a very selfish person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She&#8217;d
scream
until she got whatever she wanted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If
my mother couldn&#8217;t give it to her, she&#8217;d have to find a way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My brothers and I, the
little ones&#8212;Irving
and Abie&#8212;were closer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I remember going out with my mother
on 2<sup>nd</sup>
Ave, because we lived between 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of a sudden there was
a woman there, and
my mother and she started screaming at each other.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I found out later that this was my father&#8217;s sister,
my Aunt Mae.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
my mother died, she took me in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
never hated her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
resented her at times, because people when they came to the
house used to think I was the maid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Anyway, on 2<sup>nd</sup>
Avenue, when I was very
young, my mother and Aunt Mae saw each other, and they yelled at each
other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother
was already not with
my father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My aunt
thought my father
was the most wonderful person in the world.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You know&#8212;it depends on what side you want to believe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was the first time I
had ever seen my
aunt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had never
encountered anybody
in the Yanowitz family at that point (the Glicks&#8212;that&#8217;s Aunt Mae).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had children, too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never saw her again
until after my mother
died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time,
I didn&#8217;t remember
that she was the one my mother yelled at.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don&#8217;t know how I remembered that.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It just came about for some reason.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My cousins, Aunt Mae&#8217;s children, had been talking
about how they used to
live on 2<sup>nd</sup> Ave.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That&#8217;s how
it came to pass, talking about what I went through with them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

never felt I had

the
things I had to learn compared to what the other workers would do, that
I had
more brains than them to try&#8212;to go ahead and learn different things so

home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were put
in quarantine for the
first couple of weeks, I think, to see if everything was all right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mostly for tuberculosis,

had TB.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were
there for awhile, and
we met other kids.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
was my first

was a whole 10

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I have to put that in because I can
never
forget when I found out what it was.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I
was playing with some black kids.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The
home was not sectarian (even though it was a Hebrew asylum).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Then I went into the main building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You stayed in a room with
like 20 other
girls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You had your
own bed, and you
had to change the sheets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We&#8217;d
have to
take the top sheet and put it on the bottom.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Every week we would change.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You
kept your top sheet for your bottom, and you'd get a clean top sheet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It left a real memory on
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certain things
do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">They gave you clothes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eddie used to come and
visit us very
often.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day he
came in and he kept
looking for me, and he couldn't find me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He finally asked somebody, &#8220;Where&#8217;s my sister?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And she said, &#8220;There she
is.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She&#8217;s been
there all along.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was standing at a window, looking out,
looking for him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
my body had
changed so much that he hadn&#8217;t recognized me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It isn&#8217;t how long he hadn&#8217;t seen me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He never realized from the back of me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was a skinny kid, and all of a sudden I had
matured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had
breasts, I had a behind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Didn&#8217;t
look like the same person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
happens almost overnight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was 12.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is before my mother died, just before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">After quarantine, Irving, Abie and
I went
to the main home, but not Eddie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was
left in quarantine and sent somewhere else.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was 12 and he was 16, something like that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>17, I think.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They put him
someplace where he could go out and look for a job.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">When my mother died, my father took
me out of the
home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hy got in
touch with him after my
mother died, and my father took me out and put me in with Aunt Mae.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went there when I wasn&#8217;t
13 yet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know I
was there when I was 13, because
one of my other aunts brought me a gift, which I remember very well: I
didn&#8217;t
receive many gifts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">There was a time when they would
shush and hush.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
once shouted at my aunt for doing
that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were
talking about my
mother, and I started to yell and scream at Aunt Mae.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was a very docile child until something hit me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I let them get away and
get away, and then
all of a sudden they&#8217;d just hit the wrong spot, and I&#8217;d sit up and
scream at
them, and they&#8217;d have to hear me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Aunt Mae had daughters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Harriet (they called her
Terry) and Elsie were home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
others were married and out of the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mike, her
son, was home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
Friday you had to clean.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
had this great big old-fashioned wood
table in the dining room, and you had to polish it.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You had to wash all the wood walls.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The others were supposed to help, but they always
found something
else to do, especially Elsie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Harriet
helped, but she was younger, so she got away with things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was called Mickie at
that point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
cousin, Mike, called me Mickie, which I
hated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn&#8217;t
cook&#8212;my aunt did the
cooking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She used
to brag: she was
going out one day, and she was in her gown, and she didn&#8217;t like the way
the
floor looked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
she washed the floor
and didn&#8217;t get a bit of dirt on her...so how come I couldn&#8217;t do this??<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i style="">[Chuckle]</i><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Cousin Flo, one of Aunt Mae&#8217;s
daughters&#8212;the oldest one&#8212;would wait for me to come home from school,
and she&#8217;d
leave right away and I&#8217;d have to watch the kids.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I wasn&#8217;t even a reader then.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I got used to it, I realized it wasn&#8217;t <i style="">my</i> life I was living.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">One day she had company, and I
understand it was
cousins of mine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was 13, I
think.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;d been
living with Aunt Mae
for 6, 7 months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
child said to her
mother, &#8220;Does Aunt Mary...&#8221;&#8212;Aunt Mae is Aunt Mary, too&#8212;&#8220;does Aunt Mae
have a
maid?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is she the
maid?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That made me
sit up and think what the hell
is going on here?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even
at that age, I
didn&#8217;t want to be a maid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I wrote to my father who was in the
South, and said I
don&#8217;t want to stay there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>People
think
I&#8217;m a maid, and I&#8217;m not a maid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
was when I was 14 or 15.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
he came
back and took me down South for awhile.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I lived with him and Jean and Ed for a time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had a little place
where they sold knick-knacks, all these
pretty little things that people buy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In Memphis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
really had a good
time with Ed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was just the two of
us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He didn&#8217;t have
a job.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went to
shool.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">According to my father, when I was
still
with my Aunt Mae, we were up in the country.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We took a coupling, a country place where you can
cook, but they have
many stoves in the kitchen, 2-burner stoves for families.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We stayed up there, and we
had the whole
kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My Aunt
Mae made one of the
Jewish holidays up there then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was
fourteen, fifteen&#8212;something like that.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I had gone up with my aunt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It
was in the summer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
had a very bad
asthma attack, so I had to sit up all night long.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My father would come up with Jean, and I would have
to sleep in
the living room, because my uncle came, my aunt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Up to then I&#8217;d sleep with my aunt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It turned out my aunt made this big
dinner
for the holidays, and my father and I got to talking.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He said to me, &#8220;You know, don&#8217;t think so badly of me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was very young when your
mother and I got
married.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was too
young.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">So why did he have six kids if he
was that
young?<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i style="">[Brief chuckle]</i><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And your
father&#8217;s story tells that every time he had a child, he would dare to
make the
child, but then he would leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
was one time that she gave birth, and he was sitting at the table.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You know, all these
neighbors bring food?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
one of the women told me later, and my
aunt told me later, he sat there eating like a pig while she was
screaming in
the bedroom giving birth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
think it
was to me, because it was twins.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">So it was his explanation that he
couldn't
take it because he was too young.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I
think he <i style="">was </i><span style="">&nbsp;</span>pretty
young&#8212;in his early twenties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Before Hy and Eddie went into the
CCC,
they had no money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They'd
come to
visit, and every once in awhile my aunt would let them eat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But then she got tired of
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hy, it seems,
used to go to Ruthie&#8217;s, and
Ruthie would help him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
Ed would
come to see me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
day he came and he
hadn&#8217;t eaten.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
wanted to take me out
for a walk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I
sneaked back in the
house and I made him a sandwich.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
felt
terrible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s my
brother, he&#8217;s
starving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
thankful; he was
hungry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I wasn&#8217;t a reader in those days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was a poor reader.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn&#8217;t like movies; they
scared me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
were no talkies at the time, so I didn&#8217;t
enjoy it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even when
I got older and
lived with Aunt Mae, and she went to the movies every day, she said,
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t
you come?&#8221; but I said no.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Movies were
a dime then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If I
babysat, I&#8217;d get a
dime for babysitting all night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or
they&#8217;d give me money and say to go to the movies.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My friends weren&#8217;t scared of the movies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I don&#8217;t remember having
many friends when I
was living with Aunt Mae.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">People around me loved the movies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I didn&#8217;t.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn&#8217;t want to get so
involved in other people&#8217; lives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
didn&#8217;t even read so much at that point, so
it was a lot to deal with.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I remember Harriet even would go to
the movies and I
wouldn&#8217;t go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
don&#8217;t remember how that
fear started.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
probably afraid
something on the screen was going to come out and get me; I don&#8217;t know.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It started with piano in the movie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You went in and they had a
piano playing and
subtitles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was
before the
talkies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m 72
years old, you
know!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So they had a
piano going, and
you never knew what they were really saying.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And I couldn't read well enough to see what was on
the screen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
couldn't read.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
was probably it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I didn&#8217;t see movies until my mother
died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I moved
to Aunt Mae, this
was the thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
house was on Simpson
St., and the movie theater was on Southern Boulevard, just a block away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And she went all the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She went practically every
day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wouldn't go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She wanted to take me a
lot of times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
daughters would go.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Movies were like a nickel in the afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was no big deal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On a
Saturday or something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
I didn&#8217;t
like movies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
took me a long time
before I really enjoyed it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
liked
plays.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did go
with Aunt Mae a couple
of times because she kept insisting that I have to go so she could get
the
dishes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They gave
dishes out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">They were talkies now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I kept thinking it would
be the same
way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just
remembered that I didn&#8217;t
like them, and why should I bother?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>People used to tease me, but I didn&#8217;t like it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My brothers were enamored
with movies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
went crazy over movies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">But I liked it better.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I understood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">With my mother, when we lived on 4<sup>th</sup>
Street, she would take all us kids to Wanamaker&#8217;s on a Saturday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Saturday or Sunday,
Wanamaker&#8217;s always had a
theater, and they sometimes had ballets, sometimes other things, like
plays.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That&#8217;s when
we started to see things like
plays.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wanamaker&#8217;s
was on 8<sup>th</sup>
Street and Lexington Ave, I believe.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It&#8217;s not there any more.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It&#8217;s
right near where David had a play.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It&#8217;s
diagonally across from the Shakespearean theater.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We could walk there, because we wouldn't ride on a
Saturday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this
was free, so there was no money
involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
couldn't ride on Saturday
but we could see the play because we didn&#8217;t pay for it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There&#8217;s a difference because you didn&#8217;t
spend money and you could walk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
could have been Sunday; I may be wrong about what day it was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">My Aunt Mae used to take me to
plays, and
those didn&#8217;t scare me, because they were people up there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And you knew they were

</span>I never acted after, but that&#8217;s all right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">As an adult, I used to play hookey,
when I went to
work and I knew there was a good play on Broadway.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All of a sudden I got sick, at three o&#8217;clock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two o&#8217;clock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To go to a matinee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I saw
<i style="">Oklahoma</i> that way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I saw a lot of good plays
that way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I found
out that if you go to the office
just before the show began, you could get in.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I went over to the office and said, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t got
more than $25.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Do
you have a seat?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
I would get in the orchestra.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
is when I was still working.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
worked until about 6 years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
would let me in, as long as there were
seats available.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They'd
rather fill it
up than have it empty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
learnt it as
something that happened, to see if I could get in for $25, and then I
realized
you could <i style="">do </i>this.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sometimes I&#8217;d stand on line and get
tickets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lately I
haven&#8217;t seen any
plays.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Sylvia had to be sent to Craig
Colony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That&#8217;s a
hospital, or a place
for people like her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
elipepsy was <i style="">grand mal</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was very bad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
would have her fits, and she&#8217;d get banged up with them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would be very awkward.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was one time years later, when Eddie and
Mae were married, they took Sylvia home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were still in the city, lived on the west side
in the Bronx.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
took her out of the home, helping to be
able to help her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mae
was pregnant with
you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I came home
one day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mae was
very upset.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had
gone to work, she was home, Eddie was
out working.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
told us that Sylvia
had tried to beat up on her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
they
couldn't keep her under those conditions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You can&#8217;t keep somebody that way.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mae was very tiny compared to Sylvia, who was about
5-6, 5-7, and Mae is
no more than 5-2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
Sylvia was big,
and Mae is very petite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s
hard to
believe we were all petite at one time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Anyhow, they decided it was no good.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was too dangerous to
keep her
around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tried one
time to take her
out, and it didn&#8217;t work at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
became very nasty and abusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
didn&#8217;t work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
had <i style="">grand mal</i>, and as far as I know
it&#8217;s
much worse than normal epilepsy to live with the person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have an aunt who was
epileptic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All her
life she raised a whole family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
never had this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
had <i style="">petite
mal</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
would have a fit, it would
go past.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;ve known
a couple of people
who&#8217;ve had <i style="">petite mal</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when you have <i style="">grand mal</i>, you bang your head so often,
you're bound to do some
damage, I guess.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 10pt;">[I
sense a lot guilt in the family around Sylvia.]<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Yeah, you always feel guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We went up to visit her,
Leo and I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sammy
was a baby at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
all she wanted was pennies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sylvia
had this thing that she had to count
pennies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She gave
her dollar, she would
change it into pennies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
bulk of it
was important to her, not the actual money.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Everything had to become something she could carry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were times when I
worked for Uncle
Irving that I bought her clothes, and I would send it to her; and when
I would
visit her, I found out that she had sold it so she could have pennies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To me, I spent $7 on one
of the skirts I
sent her...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
so beautiful, I had
wanted it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I
had to send my sister
something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cost
$7, and when I came
up, she didn&#8217;t have it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was about
17.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And she had
turned it into
pennies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t
know what happened to
the pennies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
didn&#8217;t have that much
money; she didn&#8217;t get hold of that much money.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She didn&#8217;t turn $7 into pennies.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She may have turned it into a quarter of pennies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It wasn&#8217;t the value of the
thing, but how
many pennies could somebody give her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She would take the pennies instead of the garment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It wasn&#8217;t the value that
she used.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For me it
was $7, and I worked for it for a
week.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">She was fixated on whatever she
wanted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She used to
want different
things, and my mother would go and buy it for her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Like a doll.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
saw
something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or she
wanted a hair ribbon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Sylvia was always disturbed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then she became religious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She became Catholic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She believes in Christ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You know, you don&#8217;t tell
people, &#8220;Don&#8217;t
believe,&#8221; just &#8216;cause you're a Jew.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You
say, &#8220;If that helps you...&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
was a
very pretty girl, and she was very strong, and very capable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t think she ever had
dates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She went to
school, but there were problems
because if she had a spell, she&#8217;d have to come home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A spell meaning a fit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I
don&#8217;t know when she actually got violent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That time she got violent with your mother is the
year you were being
born.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So she was
about 22.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Sometimes she had fits, sometimes
it would
be days, and then all of a sudden it could be every day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was never more than
several days between
fits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she had
a fit, she was
out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had to be
put to bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
exhausted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
violence was something else.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The only person she hit was your mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t what happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
don&#8217;t know what happened with other people because she wasn&#8217;t living
with us
until that time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
don&#8217;t remember her
losing her temper or speaking abusively.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I have no idea what led up to that incident with
your mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All I
know is that your mother was pregnant
and she had been crying, and she had been hurt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That was enough.<a style="" href="mimimemoirstable.html#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style=""><comment title="[if !supportFootnotes]" xmlns="http://disruptive-innovations.com/zoo/nvu"><comment title="[if !supportFootnotes]" xmlns="http://disruptive-innovations.com/zoo/nvu"><img src="chrome://editor/content/images/tag-comment.gif"><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--></comment></comment>[5]<comment title="[endif]" xmlns="http://disruptive-innovations.com/zoo/nvu"><comment title="[endif]" xmlns="http://disruptive-innovations.com/zoo/nvu"><img src="chrome://editor/content/images/tag-comment.gif"><!--[endif]--></comment></comment></span></span></a><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Hy was very enamored with a cousin
of mine&#8212;Ruthie&#8212;at a
point, and she with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First
of all, Hy was an intellectual, and she was trying to
be one, which is very important to some people.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She read and read, and Hy would direct her what to
read.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She wasn&#8217;t
interested politically.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
never heard her say anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
whole family wasn&#8217;t political.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
they weren&#8217;t <i style="">anti</i>-anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never
heard them say anything very nasty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">By the way, I don&#8217;t know if you
want to put this
down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I saw my
cousin, Francine, the
one I told you about.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
husband had
died a few years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She&#8217;s
very
depressed about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
took care of his
children&#8212;8 kids, all went to college.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They're all professionals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her
own son, from her first marriage, also went to college and is doing
very
well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(She
was Hy&#8217;s&#8212;Ruthie&#8217;s youngest daughter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ruthie is my first cousin.)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And
even if she reads Eddie&#8217;s thing, he mentions something in there&#8212;he
doesn&#8217;t
think Francine was Sidney&#8217;s child.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I
told her that I wanted to introduce her to her cousins.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She said, &#8220;No, Sidney was my father.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I have a lot of people, a lot of children, I
don&#8217;t need any more life with anyone I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I told her about Hy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She took it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, we were talking
and she said that her oldest sister was
always very embarrassed by her mother&#8217;s affairs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her mother always had affairs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So they knew of all these boyfriends, and she was a
little bummed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
love Ruthie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told
her if she wants to change, she could get in touch with
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I doubt it,
though.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She&#8217;s got
MS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it&#8217;s been
fine all these years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
has to watch it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
doctor said to her, &#8220;If you feel like running, walk.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If you feel like doing any big exercises, take it
easy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Don&#8217;t over do
it.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And she&#8217;s been
doing very well.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">She says to me&#8212;we were talking
about
family&#8212;&#8220;You know I always really thought you were the smartest one in
the

shut.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You know,
it&#8217;s a good

I was smart.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I told her she had two brothers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But she has no interest in

18 years old or something, and they asked her to get my friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She didn&#8217;t know my friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So she brought two black

to do it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Poor
Rebecca.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
girlfriend was on the same floor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She had the exact same birthday, so I had to have
her name on the

would be
very nice to me on my birthday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
would push Leo to buy a present for me or something.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don&#8217;t remember any big deals for me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I always made something
for Leo, but he never reciprocated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Men are very funny.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You have to tell them to do it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I&#8217;m sorry, but it&#8217;s true. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In Roosevelt&#8217;s time, before
1936--when he started in
with the CCC camp, in his first term&#8212;my brothers both joined the CCC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father had money to a
certain extent
because he worked&#8212;and this was the depression: a lot of people didn&#8217;t
work, and
he had a car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was a salesman and
went South, selling chances to the farmers and people in the villages
to buy
things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You could
get blankets, or you
could get dishes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was a mail order
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father
worked for his
brother, my Uncle Irving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was the head
of a crew that went to poor people<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Eddie and I used to get along very
very well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We used
to do the dishes and sing <i style="">The Mikado</i>
and all the Gilbert and
Sullivan songs, and some other songs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We had a very good time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was
going to school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
flunked English
because I couldn&#8217;t understand the English teacher.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her accent was so deep; it was like she did it
deliberately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>English
was a good language for me; here in
NY I had no problem, but there <i style="">[chuckle]</i>
I couldn&#8217;t speak English.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
failed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I had friends there, and they were
black, and you&#8217;re
not allowed to do that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
that time.
1937, many people there were still very anti-black.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don&#8217;t know what they are now.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But at that time, &#8220;What do you mean, you have black
friends?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>People
don&#8217;t want to know you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whites.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Being Jewish was an issue to a

I never hid anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
didn&#8217;t have a
hard time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had a
hard time
sometimes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I
don&#8217;t think they knew
what a Jew was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some
people just don&#8217;t
know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They&#8217;re not
brought up to
discriminate against somebody they never see.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They&#8217;re brought up to discriminate against <i style="">blacks</i> because those they see.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I had no problem.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They lived behind us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Blacks
lived in the alleyway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
were on the
street side, and they were in the back.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There were no blacks in our school; the ones I knew
were from the
neighborhood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
didn&#8217;t know about
discrimination until it hits you.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There
was no reason I shouldn&#8217;t know blacks&#8212;there weren&#8217;t that many where we
lived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I was
in the home, I was
very friendly with an Oriental girl.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My
father wouldn&#8217;t say anything, because it would only come back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He may have said he had a
different name, but
he wasn&#8217;t about to...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
could be
customers, too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
he wasn&#8217;t anti-black.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
never talked about it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">My brother, Eddie, worked in the
store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was going
to school down there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
think he had some problems in school
because he was Jewish, but I don&#8217;t remember what they were.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We used Yanowitz when we
were in
school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You had to
register.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father
didn&#8217;t deny being &#8220;Yanowitz.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
used &#8220;Mr. Louis&#8221; because, he said, it was
easier for people to remember.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Jean
picked up a Southern accent and never lost it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even I had a little bit of something when I came
back, at about the age
of 15.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wasn&#8217;t
there long&#8212;a year or
two.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Then I moved in with Flo when I
came back, about 15,
and when I was 16, I moved out again and found my own apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went to work for Uncle
Irving, and as soon
as I found that job, I moved out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">While I lived with Flo, I went back
to school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
brother, too, went back to school.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We both went to a school in Brooklyn where
you had to pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
needed only one
course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They said
he had to do
history.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(This is
late 1930s, before he
knew Mae.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had a
teacher who was a
real reactionary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
was before the
US was in the war, but the war was on in Europe.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The teacher believed the Germans were right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Try to learn something
under such a
teacher!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ed didn&#8217;t
get his diploma
then, because he couldn&#8217;t take the teacher.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I understood far less.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was a
very naive person compared to other people that I know today.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>People at that age today
are so much
brighter and know what is going on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I
didn&#8217;t.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I didn&#8217;t finish high school at that
point, but I did
after I had children.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Some time after my mother died, my
Aunt Helen (my
mother&#8217;s sister) wanted me to go live with her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She lived in Rockford, Illinois.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But I was already 18, 19 years old by this time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had wanted me earlier,
while my mother
was still alive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
mother had 6 kids,
and Helen felt if she took me, it would unburden my mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But my mother told her no.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She wouldn&#8217;t give up any
of her children,
although we were very, very poor, we were on welfare, and she was a
very sick
woman by that time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
some time after
my mother died&#8212;I was about 18&#8212;my aunt again offered to take me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I said no.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was already working, I
was very independent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
don&#8217;t know what happened, but I don&#8217;t
think she knew for maybe 5 years that her sister had died.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">She had children&#8212;two or three
children that died in a
tornado where they lived in Illinois.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Two were killed in a tornado, and the other one died
fighting in the
war.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She lost all
her children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
think that&#8217;s when she decided she wanted
me to come and live there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">There was a time when I needed
pajamas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I had
come out of the home I had some
clothes from them, but I didn&#8217;t have much.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So my father said, &#8220;You&#8217;ll make your own.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn&#8217;t have a sewing
machine.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Everything had to be done by hand.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was very stingy when it came to me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was stingy period&#8212;when it came to Jean even.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For her birthday, he&#8217;d go
out and buy
himself a box of cigars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
was
typical of him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He&#8217;d
say, &#8220;I bought you
a present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m
smoking them.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
sounds funny, but it became a joke.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You just didn&#8217;t expect him to do any better
than that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was
a big story in our
family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He always
did it; he thought it
was funny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would
do this every
year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;She wants
something?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let her
go out and buy it herself.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
wouldn&#8217;t worry about giving Christmas
gifts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Jean worked in the store with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I guess she had access to
the money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She&#8217;d
been a bookkeeper at one point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
could have gone out and spent if she
wanted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Eddie worked in Idaho.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eddie, according to what
he tells in his
story, worked chopping down trees and things, and because he knew how
to drive,
they made him a driver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then
he had to
cook, because a driver had to cook for the crew.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hy must have gone somewhere else, because I know the
story with
Hy is that while they were up in the CCC camps, he was helping people
to learn
how to write and read English, because they were very uneducated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t know if this was
his job or just
something he did on the side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
one
of the guys that he taught to write English ended up to be a crook, and
when he
stole something he wrote a beautiful note,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><i style="">[Laughing]</i><span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t know what he did,
but he wrote
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hy told the
story that this guy who
didn&#8217;t know how to write English all of a sudden became a writer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Hy had like s photographic mind. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>He never finished high
school.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
you couldn't compete with him in
knowledge because he read anything and everything.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">At one point I wasn&#8217;t working for
some reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went
from my uncle&#8217;s place when I was 16
or 17.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can&#8217;t
remember these
dates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I quit
school at a very young
age&#8212;I think it was 16.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
went to work
for my uncle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
war in Europe had
already started then.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It was a mail order house, and I
was filling
envelopes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My uncle
was giving me $4 a
week, and I said, &#8220;I want an increase.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He said, &#8220;Go ask Sokoloff,&#8221; who was his partner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sokoloff said, &#8220;Yeah,
sure,&#8221; and he gave me
an increase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But a
few weeks later, I
said this is ridiculous&#8212;from $4 to $6, something like that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was working 8 hours a
day, 40 hours a
week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(But it was
only a nickel to get
a hot dog, a nickel to go on the subway.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It&#8217;s all relative.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">And then I went out and found
myself this job working
on table cloths.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was a sewing machine
operator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a
sweat shop, but it
was clean and nice and neat. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>I
don&#8217;t
think I belonged to a union yet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was
in the West 30s in Manhattan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
got $17
right off the bat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was making
tablecloths&#8212;decorative tablecloths.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was no pattern, and I would know in my head
that if I held the
tablecloth in a certain way the decoration would be right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">From there I went out and found
other jobs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Underwear
and different things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everything
was seasonal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;d
work at one job, maybe several months,
until they laid you off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;d
find
another job right away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
didn&#8217;t
collect unemployment, not because I couldn&#8217;t but because I didn&#8217;t want
to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would always
find a new job.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m
the type of person who, if they showed
me one machine and somebody else was working on a different type of
machine, I
had to learn it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not
because the boss
said learn it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
wanted to learn
everything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That&#8217;s
why I was never out
of work&#8212;because I knew everything.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I
learned so many different things.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These
were all garment industry jobs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
salary kept getting higher and higher.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Especially during the war, it went into the 40s.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That&#8217;s a lot of money,
when you&#8217;ve started
at $4 and a few years later you&#8217;re making a lot more.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And even after the war you still made.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I worked on parachutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not parachutes for men,
but parachutes for supplies that were dropped.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I&#8217;d sew the parachute.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I had a 4-needle machine, and it flops over
and makes...it would have a seam&#8212;on your shirt, that&#8217;s only 2 needles,
but ours
was 4 needles, so I&#8217;d be sewing 4 lines at a time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You&#8217;d just hold it, and it goes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was the parachute itself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The parachutes for men were silk, but these
parachutes were nylon; they
weren&#8217;t worried about a person&#8217;s life, but just to send down ammunition
or
whatever.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">After the war, I still worked in
the garment industry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">When I was working during the war,
they used to say,
&#8220;Loose lips sink a ship.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
people
would say, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s a lot of baloney.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And I said, &#8220;Wait, I&#8217;ll show you.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Now we had a 4-story building where I was working.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And I said, &#8220;Watch this.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Somebody passed me by, and
I made a
statement&#8212;I forget exactly, something about, &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re going to be
laid
off.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 20
minutes, it came down, &#8220;Did
you hear we&#8217;re going to be laid off?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I
mean, this is the way rumors can go.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I
was trying to prove a point to somebody: &#8220;Watch, if you say something
here, the
4<sup>th</sup> floor is going to get it, and then we&#8217;re
going to get it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
will go through the whole building.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I was just saying there are certain
things you don&#8217;t
talk about, even in your own private life.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You keep your mouth shut about certain things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But some people go
overboard with it, too&#8212;I had a friend who did
that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">What else did I do?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I even did dressmaking.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I worked
in non-union shops to try to help organize them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The trouble is, the ILG is such a horrible mess,
that I would
help out to try to organize, and then I was in a place where they
literally had
me fired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ILGWU
had me fired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i style="">[David]</i>
Dubinsky, no less.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
felt that
everybody should contribute to the Labor Party, and there were a lot of
people
who weren&#8217;t Labor Party people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
I
don&#8217;t feel you had a right to force people to contribute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is after the war&#8212;the
American Labor
Party, Henry Wallace&#8217;s party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
just
felt that people were complaining, and I don&#8217;t think the union had a
right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had to
give one day&#8217;s
earnings to the Labor Party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
day
for the year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
have about 50 people
working, it&#8217;s a lot of money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
they
insisted you had to do it, and I talked about not doing it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I got in trouble, and
then they had me
fired.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The shop was now a union shop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had organized this place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They didn&#8217;t fire me&#8212;they
had the boss do it,
and they wouldn&#8217;t defend me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Another time I irritated them
because the ILG decided
that instead of us having 2 weeks vacation, they would take our
vacation money
and split it with everybody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All
the
union members who were working had to split their money with people who
weren&#8217;t
working.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I
didn&#8217;t believe
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I believed
they took it and put
it in their pockets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
never found
anybody who didn&#8217;t work who ever got anything from the union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I fought it, because I
felt it was just
another thing that the union was doing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The ILG tried to say that they were a liberal union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were far from liberal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I was in the Communist Party at the
time and I
realized&#8212;a lot of people told me, &#8220;Hey, the ILG stinks.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ILG claimed to be a
communist union, but
with Dubinsky, you had to be very careful.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I knew enough, because I was in the Party, that you
don&#8217;t just accept
people because it&#8217;s a union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like
my
union that I ended up in&#8212;the last one (at GHI), I used to fight with
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knew that
they were only going to fight as
hard as you want to make them fight.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You don&#8217;t accept unions because they&#8217;re unions.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Somebody even
told me this, whom I didn&#8217;t
agree with at the time, but she was right: she hated the union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was the first union
she ever was
in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it&#8217;s true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You just can&#8217;t ignore what
could be happening
under your nose, because they don&#8217;t want you to know.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You have to be careful even with the more
progressive unions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I don&#8217;t know if they were all this
way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father was
in the Furriers, and he
believed in them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
yet my father was
a sceptic, because he used to say to me when I was in the Party,
&#8220;Remember,
nobody is a god.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">People would get up and sing,
&#8220;Browder is our
leader.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn&#8217;t
do it, because I
remembered that, although I never liked my father, I felt what he said
was
true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Never put
anybody up as a god.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
is no such thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
I would never be able to sing the song.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I wasn&#8217;t what you would call a good
communist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn&#8217;t
believe in everything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hy
was a much better communist than I.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He and Leo were very much Stalinites.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn&#8217;t know enough to be
a Stalinite, and
I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to do certain things.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was in the party, I recruited people, it&#8217;s true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But not on the basis of
Russia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather:
you&#8217;re a worker, and you have to
understand what&#8217;s going on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Hy was in the party when we still
lived in lower
Manhattan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
girlfriend even
joined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got in
early 42/late
41--around Pearl Harbor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
lived with
Eddie and Mae, but just before that I lived with some people, I boarded
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(We lived in
a basement
apartment near Jean and my father in Brooklyn.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don&#8217;t remember the street&#8212;it&#8217;s a long time ago.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was just 20.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My joining had nothing to
do with Hy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had
more to do with these people, these friends of mine.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I ended up living with them, being very
friendly with them, and then when Ed and Mae found an apartment, I went
to live
with them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
were party members.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I never really resigned from the
party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t
agree with it any more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Basically,
I agree with it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
just don&#8217;t believe in men being honored to
the point where they could do no wrong.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Like Leo still believes in Stalin no matter what he
was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know a
number of people who are like
this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You prove to
me that something&#8217;s
wrong, then something&#8217;s wrong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nobody
is an idol.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I&#8217;ve always been in unions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I believed in unions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
mother believed in unions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
mother
was a socialist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
father was in the
Furriers Union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
had to be careful
because he had lost his <i style="">[American]</i>
citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
a naturalized
citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was a
big man with very big
hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They would
go into open shops at
night, where they had workers working at night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was caught banging heads around.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So he went to jail, and he lost his citizenship.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">He actually beat people up, with
other people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was a strongarm guy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
object was to make people scared so
they&#8217;d join the Furriers Union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
union sent him and these people out as a conscious organizing activity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Who was head of the union
at the time?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ben
Gold?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When he was running away from the police, I
understand that he stayed at
our house to hide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was probably still
a kid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
before my father was with
Jean.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t know
if Gold got caught. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>There&#8217;s
a book we have somewhere on the
Furriers Union.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">When you go to an open shop, you
can&#8217;t just walk in
and say, &#8220;You can&#8217;t work here.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They&#8217;d
call the police and throw you out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So
you have to go in and be sneaky.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
didn&#8217;t know what he was doing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
only
heard these stories later on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
police may have come while he was there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I know he was arrested.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But he
told me he had lost his citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If
you go to jail, you lose your citizenship.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was brought up on TV recently.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was watching a show.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don&#8217;t
know how long he went to jail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maybe
it&#8217;s that you can&#8217;t vote any more.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But
he couldn&#8217;t go out of the country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I had no problem when I went to
GHI, which was the
first job I had in an office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before
that, I worked for Head Start.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
is after
I went back to school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
volunteered:
all my kids were either in school or day care.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was in a Methodist church.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I got along very well with the minister.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The girl who got me into
the work was the educator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
did everything, except she was afraid of
the minister.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was her minister, but
she was afraid he wouldn&#8217;t do what she asked, so she used to send me to
ask him
for things that she wanted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
asked,
&#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t she come and ask me?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He
was an easy guy to get along with.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He
was black, and she was white, although she didn&#8217;t discriminate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got along with her and
all the
mothers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only
thing is, I had a
very bad memory for names.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">When they closed this head start
and opened it where I
was living in the project up in the Bronx near 233<sup>rd</sup>
St., they asked
me to take over as the main homemaker, for $100 a week, which was a lot
of
money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said I
can&#8217;t take the job
because I have such a bad memory that I&#8217;m embarrassed not to be able to
know
the mothers&#8217; names.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
said, &#8220;But
you&#8217;re so much better than the one who&#8217;s there.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The one who was doing this work in the church was a
black woman,
very aristocratic, and the mothers didn&#8217;t like her because they
couldn&#8217;t talk
to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She always
had a smile, and she
was sweet, but they felt no rapport.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Most of them were black.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The whole idea at the beginning of
the Head Start
program was to mix children of different ethnic backgrounds and
different
financial backgrounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some
of the kids
we had were very wealthy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now
it has
become really for the poor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
think
they&#8217;d like the ethnic background to be there, but they&#8217;re having a
problem
with that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
are places I&#8217;ve been
out of town where the children are all white.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They have them everywhere, but they don&#8217;t have rich
kids in there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
rich kids are the hardest to deal
with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They want
more than you could
give.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our children
were very good, very
bright.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next
step was to go into
school, and we felt they didn&#8217;t need to go into kindergarten because
they&#8217;d
already learned a lot of things, more than most kindergarten children.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I enjoyed the work there, but I
found it was a little
much.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a bad
inferiority
complex.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
unsure of myself, didn&#8217;t
think I was worth anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was
awful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I
finally got this job in
GHI, my doctor called the boss up there&#8212;the president&#8212;and told him she
wanted
me to work 3 days a week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
they
didn&#8217;t have 3 days a week&#8212;they had part-time work, but it was 5 days a
week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She felt I
shouldn&#8217;t be working
too much, because it was after I&#8217;d been ill.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was 25 years ago&#8212;I started there in 1969.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">When I took the job there, I
realized I wasn&#8217;t
stupid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I became a
shop steward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
knew a little more than somebody
else.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I realized my
memory wasn&#8217;t that
bad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were
times I fought, not
just for my workers all the time, but I fought for people who came in
for
claims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had
memory about what was
right and what was wrong.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Do you know what Jobst hose is?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They&#8217;re a stocking that
people with
phlebitis wear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their
leg is measured,
every inch, so it only fits them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When
I first came in, I was taught by somebody who was working on this all
the time,
and she had told me that the insurance paid for this.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Months later, or maybe a couple of years later,
somebody came in
and they were being rejected for Jobst hose, and I said, &#8220;You can&#8217;t
reject the
claim.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nobody
remembered that it&#8217;s
payable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s a
medical service, like a
cane.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hose at $100,
or $55, or whatever
it was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They&#8217;re
expensive because
they&#8217;re made for just one person.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I
finally won out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
finally found
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are books
and books and books
and books in these places.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
of my
friends finally found it for me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
was a correspondent and sort of remembered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But I felt so sure of myself about certain things,
which gave me a lot
more to be proud of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
wasn&#8217;t the way I
had been.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">When I worked at GHI, I was very
proud of myself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
realized that I had a better memory than I
ever gave myself credit for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
had a
temper that when I sat down at a negotiations table, they listened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a time that I
fought for certain
things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had a
4-day week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
didn&#8217;t have to fight for it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
union and the boss decided the city
needs to have a 4-day week, with 35 hours over that time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even management wanted it,
but the workers,
both men and women, didn&#8217;t want it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They said, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to have to work so many
hours!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It came out
to 8 ¾ hours a day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;I
have a baby at home.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;I
have a sitter, and she&#8217;s going to be
angry.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eight and
three-quarter hours
on the phone is a long day, after all.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And you got less of a lunch to make those hours and
get out at a decent
hour.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You only took
a half-hour
lunch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the
7-hour day, you had an
hour lunch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
you looked at it, it
didn&#8217;t sound right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">But I got up, and I spoke so
eloquently; I didn&#8217;t know
I had it in me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
wasn&#8217;t in on
negotiations of that nature at that point.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Only a handful of people were allowed to sit in
towards the end when you
negotiated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I said, &#8220;Listen, a 4-day week is a
very great
step.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>People were
booing me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked
around, and I said, &#8220;You know, I
didn&#8217;t boo anybody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
didn&#8217;t agree with
people, but I didn&#8217;t boo them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
think
I should have a right to speak.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
I
spoke.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn&#8217;t
believe what came out
of my mouth, because I convinced everybody we should have a 4-day week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told them the history of
how people in
labor used to have to work a 20-hour day, or a 10-hour day, and then
they came
down, and they finally got the 8-hour day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>&#8220;Now look at us: we have only a 7-hour day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is progress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
don&#8217;t want to go back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Think
about what
you could do with an extra day at home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You can go away for a long weekend.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I did a terrific job, because by the time I had
spoken, we had 100%.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It becomes part of our family:
we&#8217;re not afraid to
open up when we have to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
we had
the 4-day week, management realized it wasn&#8217;t good for them, but I
wouldn&#8217;t let
them take it away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
again had to stand
up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was not
that big a meeting,
but I was in it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was one of the
speakers, and when they kept saying we have to do it, I got up and
yelled,
&#8220;We&#8217;re not doing it!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We&#8217;ll
strike
before we do it.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
happened at the
end of a 2-year contract during which we had the 4-hour day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">We used to have shop stewards all
over the place, and
they said they didn&#8217;t want so many.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To
sit at the table, you had to be chosen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After that, I was always chosen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Once you sit at the table, you&#8217;re still not allowed
to open your
mouth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They tell
you that only the
union representative and the chief shop steward could speak.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I had learned already
that management
and the union are in cahoots to a great extent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They&#8217;ve made decisions before you even know it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You&#8217;re fighting it, and
they&#8217;ve already
decided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So you
have to open your
mouth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I learned
this over years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Now, I&#8217;m not there any more, but
they don&#8217;t try it any
more&#8212;to take away the 4-day week from those people who have it (which

I was there,

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The last union I had&#8212;it worked for
office workers:
When I went to one of my first meetings, someone told me that GHI, whom
I
worked for, was buying a hospital and a building, and we were kept in
the dark
about this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now the
union knew this,
but they didn&#8217;t do anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
when
we came to negotiations, they gave us like a 10 cents increase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>10 cents or 10%--I know
it&#8217;s a big
difference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went
to them and said, &#8220;I
hear they&#8217;re doing this and that.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And
they said, &#8220;Yeah, we know.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
I said,
&#8220;How can we go with such a little increase?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We can&#8217;t do that.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I wasn&#8217;t on
the board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
just sitting in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">There&#8217;s many times you fight your
union more than you
fight your boss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;ve
done this a
number of times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
<i style="">bosses</i> understand what I want;
my union
doesn&#8217;t want to fight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyhow,
we got
our increase properly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
think we got
10%&#8212;the union representative wanted us to have $10.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After that, we had a couple of incidences...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m very pro-union, but I
won&#8217;t let the
union screw me, either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m
not blind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The head of the union, who died
just recently, he and
I got along.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
union gave me a gold
watch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had
retired already, and they
had my girlfriend take me to Atlantic City to one of their big meetings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt that was very nice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My girlfriend was sick,
and she took me to
Atlantic City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
knew I was getting
an honor; I didn&#8217;t know why.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Normally,
they don&#8217;t ask retirees unless they&#8217;re active, and I wasn&#8217;t active.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not any more, because I
hadn&#8217;t been well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The head of the union got up on the
stage and said, &#8220;I
have to honor one of our members who is no longer working&#8221;&#8212;I had no
idea who he
was talking about; I was talking on the side&#8212;&#8220;I have to honor her,
although we
didn&#8217;t always see eye to eye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
fought
on certain issues.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He&#8217;s
right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We did.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I didn&#8217;t let him get away with it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If I knew I was right, I insisted I was right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then they called me up to
give me my watch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Which
they didn&#8217;t have with them, because
it&#8217;s being engraved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
have it now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
think that was very nice, to
acknowledge...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
was at least 5
years ago. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Your parents bought the farm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was still in New York.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You were born in Bronx
Hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that
time they called in Bronx Hospital.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was Fox St., then Bleecker St.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Your sister wasn&#8217;t born yet.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then the one in Borough Park was the
next.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From there I
think they went to
the farm. <i style="">{Editor&#8217;s memory: We went to
the farm in 1946, when I was 4 and my sister was 2.]<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I thought from Fox St. they had
moved to
the farm because I remember that I was away and my girlfriend took over
the apartment
in Fox St.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For some
reason, I remember,
she was having a problem keeping it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Your mother had to come in from out of town to save
it for her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
came in, I thought, from Jersey, to go
to court with her so she could keep the apartment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Cora, that is.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Cora and I
lived in the apartment together for awhile.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then I left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
went to Europe,
then came back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s
a bit muddled
now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Your mother
may remember this
better.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">So they went down to the farm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I came back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember when I came
back Judi was like three years old,
sitting on the couch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
was
delicious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I adored
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But you know,
I adore babies, I adore
children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stayed
because your mother

time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He got
pneumonia. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>You got
Scarlet Fever.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Your brother was almost dying, you got very sick,

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">There was one point that your

very angry with me because I said I want to go back to New York.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s no place for me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I mean I wanted to meet
people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was young.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wanted to live my life.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And she said, &#8220;Well if I&#8217;d known that, I wouldn't
have had another
baby.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inside I
boiled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn&#8217;t
say anything more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
tried to talk me into not moving.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I had just read <i style="">[Lestantio?]</i>
de Moro&#8217;s book, <i style="">A
Place of Splendor</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was very taken
by it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had
opened a place in
Mexico.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Your
parents had read this in
one of the books or papers or something, and they offered to send me
there for
a vacation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I
said, &#8220;No.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I want
to go back to New York.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I was there on the farm quite a
number of
years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But your mother took it
for granted I was
staying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You get to
a point where,
&#8220;Hey!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eventually I
want to get married,
eventually <i style="">I </i>want children.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had to have friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had no friends there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s a farm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How many friends?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You had
a couple of friends that were your mother&#8217;s or father&#8217;s friends&#8217;

did I have?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
was nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">They needed me because they were so
worried about David.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was so badly
sick that Dr. Ernst said he needed some penicillin, and it had just
come
out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ernst sent
Eddie to Atlantic City
to pick up the medication, but Ernst had no idea how to use it, and he
poured
it into David&#8217;s mouth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
baby&#8217;s mouth
was burnt, and he couldn't even drink a bottle.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was horrible.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I think
they had to give him intravenous at the time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don&#8217;t know how it worked.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But
he was in horrible pain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
the
pneumonia, he had to have this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">He finally recuperated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had been a big fat
baby, and everybody
said he shouldn't have been that fat.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thank God he was fat!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He had
enough fat to lose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
may not have
existed if he was a skinny baby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
always get annoyed when people say a baby&#8217;s too fat.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>&#8220;Leave him alone!<span style="">&nbsp;

said, &#8220;No, no.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
have to have hot water!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
don&#8217;t.<span style="">&nbsp;

water.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did you
ever see the bottom of a

has it got down
there?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A coil.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s got coils.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I mean, she didn&#8217;t have
hot water for two days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
had a dishwasher full.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
said use it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever
it is.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All I
know: the doctor had said if she didn&#8217;t have a dishwasher, we would
have all
been sick.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I
assumed it had to wash
them, too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
couldn't have been just
the hot water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
could have used the
hot water in the sink<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You

</span>I <i style="">had </i>to know
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if I didn&#8217;t

don&#8217;t let you get on

about.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You can&#8217;t.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The last time I went to see them, I
said
to Rebecca&#8212;Rebecca takes me out&#8212;&#8220;Rebecca.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She said, &#8220;Ma, I want you to go, because you want to
see your brother so
badly.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said,
&#8220;Yeah, but I don&#8217;t want
to get into anything with my sister-in-law.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;

</span>I&#8217;ll
keep her away from you.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
I sat with
your father, and we had a wonderful talk and a wonderful time,
reminiscing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
have a good
rapport.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And she
kept Mae away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
said she didn&#8217;t say anything to Mae, but
Mae calls up later and said to Rebecca, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Tell your mother I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I&#8217;m there, mind you.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>&#8220;Tell your
mother I&#8217;m sorry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
won&#8217;t do that
again.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because
every time I saw her,
she brought up the same thing about teachers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I said it once, she never let me forget it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She didn&#8217;t apologize to me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She told my daughter.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I had gone back to New York from
your
parents&#8217; chicken farm, and when I came back to visit, Hy and Mahty were
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eddie and Hy
had had a big
fight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Do you
remember Jimmy, a black
guy, he became David&#8217;s godfather?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Jimmy
Wilson.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jimmy had
some friends who
needed a place to stay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Next
to your
house was a small house that was attached to a barn.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But it didn&#8217;t have toilet facilities or running
water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You could
sleep there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>People
were sleeping in boxes at that time,
anywhere. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">They would come in to use the place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They would walk in and use
the water and use
the bathroom, and Eddie got sick and tired of what they did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t know what
happened, but he was very
angry, and he told them they couldn't come in any more.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And Hy got very angry when he told Hy this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eddie said something like,
He&#8217;s a master of
his castle; he has a right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
he said
it to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I
went to visit I went
to Eddie first, because he picked me up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And he told me the story, and I sort of took Hy&#8217;s
side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because it
was the dead of winter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where
were they supposed to go now?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
inconvenience is one thing, but where do
these people go?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
finally got rid of
them, but it was sad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
could
understand his side, and I could understand their side, and I could
understand
Hy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it was Hy in
reverse, he would
have accepted them, period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
said,
yeah I have to accept.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because
Hy was that
type of person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
doesn&#8217;t mean he was
right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was <i style="">that </i>way. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Anyhow, these people were homeless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He gave them a roof, but
he felt they should
find another way or use a bucket and not come in and out constantly
like that,
whatever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyhow,
Hy and Eddie became
friends again before Hy left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
don&#8217;t
remember for how long they were estranged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I wasn&#8217;t there all the time, but when I came to
visit, I found out this
had happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then
I went back to New
York.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a job,
I was living my own
life then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Hy decided to go back to Europe,
and he
and Mahty and the kids stayed overnight with me in New York, and then
he
realized he hadn&#8217;t taken the tickets, they're still on the kitchen
table.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So he had to
get up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t
think he slept.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
just got up, went back to South Jersey to
pick up the tickets, and then came back to New York, and then went down
to get
his ship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He took
the Queen Elizabeth,
I think.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Hy came to South Jersey to be a
chicken
farmer because your father talked him into it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He didn&#8217;t want to.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don&#8217;t know
if he actually talked him into it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It
was a lonely life for Mahty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mahty
was
treated like...they had friends, and the woman would talk to Mahty like
<i style="">[slow, labored speech]</i>,
&#8220;You-have-to-do-...&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
know, like she
was a moron.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
Mahty understood
English.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You talk
to her like you talk
to anybody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
very upset, and she
didn&#8217;t feel that close to your mother.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don&#8217;t know if I ever said to you in this thing: my
brother and I were
very close, Eddie, and when your mother came on the scene, she was very
nice in
the beginning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then
when I lived with
them, when I came down to Jersey, I felt like she resented it at times,
Eddie
and my friendship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">You know, people don&#8217;t have to say
anything and you could feel the resentment flowing?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sometimes I said to myself, &#8220;No, no, no, you're
imagining
it.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And other
times I said, &#8220;Schmuck,
you're not imagining it, it&#8217;s there.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I
decided not to be that close.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
moved
my space back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
hadn&#8217;t been that
friendly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I got
older, we became
friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a kid
he beat me up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
as we got older, you know, Hy was over
there, and I was over here, and Eddie was a little jealous of my
attachment to
Hy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That made him
even closer to him,
when we went down South and we lived with my father down there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I don&#8217;t know if I told you that,

</span>The trip was $350 round trip to go to Paris by ship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fare itself was not
expensive, and I was
going to stay with them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
I couldn't
get back because I was on the <i style="">Ile de

</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I had a 3 month visa.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I got there, Mahty
wasn&#8217;t there
yet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had been
in Tunisia, and when
they were there, Hy got very very sick.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He tells the story, how they used to swab him in oil
to pull out the
sickness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He got
very ill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He came
back to Paris before Mahty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
came back after him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
met me, not at the boat; he met me in

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">When I got in there, he took me

got my luggage and all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
had to go

went up to

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I was always there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don&#8217;t know why.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I&#8217;m just that type of person.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><i style="">[Chuckle]</i><span style="">&nbsp; </span>They make sure I&#8217;m around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mahty was scared stiff of
the baby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
wouldn't give him a bath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
sister Papoon, Collette, was in Paris
and her brother was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
was
afraid to handle the baby, and Mahty was afraid to handle the baby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jai-Jai tells everybody
that I&#8217;m his first
mother, &#8216;cause his mother couldn't take care of the baby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was scared stiff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I showed her, &#8220;Mahty, you can bathe
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He can&#8217;t drown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He just came out of your
womb, which is full
of water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He won&#8217;t
drown, believe

the water for a

</span>She
finally conceded and accepted it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But
she was very naïve when it came to babies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">She <i style="">adored</i>
having a baby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
she was scared
stiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s a good
thing I was
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Papoon
wasn&#8217;t much better.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
made baby clothes, but the baby didn&#8217;t
even have warm clothes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like
we have
undershirts?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
made silk
undershirts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
come from a hot
climate, but in Paris it wasn&#8217;t hot any more at that point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It got hot later, and
that&#8217;s when I kept
saying, &#8220;You don&#8217;t overdress the baby.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Take some of the clothes off.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Then I came back after 6 months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order for me to get my
passage okayed, Hy
had to get&#8212;in order for me to get my passage okayed&#8212;you know, I could
get the
passage, but I couldn't get out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
needed the visa.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
the visa, so I
could stay another 3 months, he had to buy it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With cigarettes and stuff.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That
was the exchange.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
brother-in-law
used to get the cigarettes and sell them so that he had more money for
his
education.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cigarettes
were a bribe to <i style="">everybody.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></i>American cigarettes were at their height.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i style=""><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I didn&#8217;t bring cigarettes when I
came.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I brought <i style="">cream cheese</i>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My brother
only wanted cream cheese.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now
they have
cream cheese.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
for years you
couldn't get cream cheese in Paris.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The destruction in Paris from the
war
wasn&#8217;t that bad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
saw some of it, but
I don&#8217;t remember too well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
poverty
was bad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The people
who owned the
house&#8212;Hy would bring them soap, and he&#8217;d bring them some canned food.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was in the PX.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was working for the
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He came
out of the army and he got a job with the government to
find housing for their personnel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So he
had access to the PX all the time, and he knew a lot of soldiers and
generals
and this one and that one&#8212;you know, no problem.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So he would get things for them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He got soap, he got all sorts of things&#8212;and yet when
I washed clothes,
they would come up and ask me to leave the water so they could use it
to wash
their floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
wouldn't use the
soap.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were
still afraid another
pogrom would happen, or whatever you want to call it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Another war.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
weren&#8217;t Jews.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">They owned the house, and we rented
the
top.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had to go
downstairs to the
toilet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mahty used
to have to carry her
pail of whatever she did at night, pee or anything, to throw into the
toilet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You were
always afraid that
you'd drop it on the steps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because
we
had no toilet up there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was just a
two-family house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
were on the second
floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There <i style="">was </i>a bathtub, and there was a sink
upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Mahty
insisted on putting all the
groceries in the bathtub, so you couldn't use it.<span style="">&nbsp;

I made my own, not bought it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
had a steamer trunk, so when I came I

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">They felt that I was very wealthy
to have
all these clothes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most
of it I had
made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when I
got to Paris, I had
made myself a purple suit and a yellow hat&#8212;yellow and purple.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A hood, not a hat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mahty thought it was
horrible.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She says, &#8220;My God!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such
colors!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next
week, all of Paris
were wearing purple and yellow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
swears that I brought the colors to Paris.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was springtime already.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So
she tells everybody, &#8220;Millie brought the colors.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I thought it was cute.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I
may have for all I know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Who
ever
thought of the combination?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Me!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also thought of the
combination blue and
green.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time
nobody wore the
color green with a navy suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If I could do
it, I did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a
nice figure in those days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
all did.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Everybody had nice figures when they were
little&#8212;young.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mahty
was gorgeous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Your
mother had a lovely figure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I didn&#8217;t speak French.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I understood a bit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I understood certain
things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I learned
one thing that I tell all my
friends when they go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
one thing you
have to know is: be polite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
French
may not be polite, but you have to be polite, and if you want to know
anything,
you say, &#8220;<i style="">Excusez-moi, s&#8217;il vous plait,
je ne pas parler français</i>.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then
you could speak English, and they will help you.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But if you go up and said, &#8220;Hey!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Do you know where this is?&#8221; they won&#8217;t say a word.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They'll walk past you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8216;Cause I did it once
without thinking, and
they looked at me like I was crazy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You
don&#8217;t talk like that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
yet when
they're here, especially when I worked downtown and I&#8217;d have people
stop me,
they'd never say excuse me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
just
say, &#8220;Je parle parler français.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
said, &#8220;No, but maybe I could understand.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>&#8216;Cause usually they speak a little English if you
speak it slowly, or
they understand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I loved Paris.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I went back a number of times.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I go now I visit other places.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I&#8217;ve gone to London since.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I&#8217;ve
taken a tour around France.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;ve
gone
to Israel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gone to
Italy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gone south.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Did you ever go to Mahty&#8217;s boyfriend&#8217;s house?<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i style="">[Conspiratorial]</i><span style="">&nbsp; </span>They don&#8217;t invite people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Me, he invites.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He thinks I&#8217;m wonderful.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mahty said he never invited people before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He doesn&#8217;t speak English,
but we have our own way, and we
laugh.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have a
feeling he understands
some more than he admits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
we get
along.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mahty
translates for us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
thing is, when I came the first time
that he was there, I brought him a present.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A scarf I think.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And he was so
delighted because nobody ever did that.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was amazed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And Mahty said, &#8220;<i style="">Nobody </i>ever
brought him a present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
you've won him.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

my
girlfriend, about 10 years ago, we first went to London and Amsterdam,
and then
we came to Paris.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
stayed with them
for a whole week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then
they took us out
to eat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before they
could take us out
to eat, I said, &#8220;Louise, you're here a whole week!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You've saved yourself a hundred dollars a day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let&#8217;s face it: you went to
a hotel, right,
and had to eat out?...&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
said, &#8220;You
buy food.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time
you pay in the
restaurant.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Oh
no, no, no, I&#8217;ll pay
with you.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;I said,
&#8220;Oh, no, no,
no.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They won&#8217;t accept from me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But you are a friend
coming with me, they'll
accept.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They <i style="">wouldn't </i>accept from me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They wouldn't allow me to spend a <i style="">penny</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wherever I go, Henry
insisted on
paying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His <i style="">friends </i>insisted on paying.<span style="">&nbsp;

wanted me to treat everybody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
know it came from her and your

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">There was my girlfriend I lived
with for
awhile, Paula.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
was very very active
in the Party, and then she met this guy, her first marriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was completely the
opposite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
active in everything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
then she married this guy who was
anti-everything she believed in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
could never understand it because I couldn't do that.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I couldn't marry somebody who was a reactionary, and
this guy
was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t know
what attracted them
to each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
was very sweet, a
lovable person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She&#8217;s dead.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was generous and very good-natured.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And I guess by that time she may have slowed down
anyway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was in
her sixties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
maybe she had slowed down enough to relax
and meet somebody who could care for her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She had a crippled hand, so she always had that
which kept her from
wanting to date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Leo
once got her a guy
from the Maritime Union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
were very
close for a long time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
broke up; I
never knew why.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Evelyn and I went to camp on
vacation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this
gorgeous hunk of a
man, six feet tall, blue-eyed, blond hair, liked me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don&#8217;t remember his name.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But he was so sweet.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was about
20.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He insisted on
dating me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You were
an infant at this point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
were dating up there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
were having a very good time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was a lover boy, and he made me feel
great.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said, &#8220;Why
did you pick me out
of all the girls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You&#8217;re
not going to
get to bed with me.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
care.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I want to be
with you.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Very
gentlemanly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
wasn&#8217;t in love.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was
enamored with him, not in love.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There&#8217;s
a difference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">That&#8217;s when I got the call from my
father
to come home and take care of Mae.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She
had hepatitis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
get a call from my
father saying, &#8220;You have to come home.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I said, &#8220;Why?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He said, &#8220;Mae has
hepatitis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Your
mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You have to
come back and take care of her.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">So I had to leave.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I had a week&#8217;s vacation, and I was called
back after a couple of days. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>We
didn&#8217;t
get back together after the camp.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I got back to the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I guess I got in by train.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The camp was upstate New
York
somewhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Camp
Unity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not as high
up as Albany.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I
got back, and your grandparents (your
mother&#8217;s parents) were sitting there like this, like they're going to
die.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were both
sitting there like they were
going to pass out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was very, very
hot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no
fan in the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Your mother
was in bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
Fox Street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
are other reasons I remember that.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I think maybe you were sleeping in the crib
at the time, but you were there already.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were so glad to see me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They couldn't breathe any more.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They just wanted to go home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They couldn't help Mae.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So my
father called <i style="">me </i>because they
couldn't take care of her, their own daughter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And I had to give up my vacation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It&#8217;s true, I resented it for the rest of my life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because they weren&#8217;t old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At my age, I go to help
people who are
sick.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m 72.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the hell was wrong
with them?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was
wrong with my father?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Your grandmother wasn&#8217;t pleasant,
and
neither was your grandfather to me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But
when that thing happened, afterwards, I was so angry that Mae was sick.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't blame Mae.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I blamed my father, but
there was nothing I
could do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because
he wasn&#8217;t there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
must have called him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
she has two sisters: they didn&#8217;t
come.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was very
resentful for a long
time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">When this thing happened, I lived

and my brother was in the Merchant Marine.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You can put this on tape. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>I&#8217;m
annoyed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">When I remembered this, I said to
myself,
&#8220;What the hell are you hiding?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You're
the one who&#8217;s the victim?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
that,
Mae got well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was ok.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We moved to
Bleecker St., with her
sister.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her sister
had a room, and
Eddie and Mae had a room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well,
Mae had
to have a room, with the baby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
were

supposed to share the rent three ways and the food three ways.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Virginia resented it
because you were there,
and Eddie was coming in on weekends, and why should she pay for you or
Eddie?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was very
selfish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Your mother didn&#8217;t make that kind
of
money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went to
work at night so that
she could work during the day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
watched you until you got old enough to go into a day care, which you
did as
soon as you were accepted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
Virginia
resented having to put out one penny more.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She made more than both of us, I think.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Not together, but either one of us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">For instance, we had ration coupons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She made sure hers were
only used for what
she used.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She would
tell us how to cook
vegetables because she wanted you to boil the water first and then put
them in
because they would lose their vitamins.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So we did it her way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">She and I were friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We used to go out together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This one day you were sick.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You had a bad cold or
something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You were
sitting in the high chair, and
Eddie was in, and her bedroom window and the kitchen window had a line
between
them to hang clothes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
came in and
opened the window in the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don&#8217;t
know if your mother or Eddie said to her, &#8220;Virginia, the baby&#8217;s sick.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Close the window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Go through your room.&#8221;<a style="" href="mimimemoirstable.html#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style=""><comment title="[if !supportFootnotes]" xmlns="http://disruptive-innovations.com/zoo/nvu"><comment title="[if !supportFootnotes]" xmlns="http://disruptive-innovations.com/zoo/nvu"><img src="chrome://editor/content/images/tag-comment.gif"><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--></comment></comment>[16]<comment title="[endif]" xmlns="http://disruptive-innovations.com/zoo/nvu"><comment title="[endif]" xmlns="http://disruptive-innovations.com/zoo/nvu"><img src="chrome://editor/content/images/tag-comment.gif"><!--[endif]--></comment></comment></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;It&#8217;s my house, too!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So Eddie got up and got

went up to Mount Vernon and told her parents that Eddie had hit her, or

her, or shoved her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
came down,
furious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I opened

</span>You don&#8217;t just
rush in!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Knock!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They weren&#8217;t there anyhow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So they proceeded to beat
up on me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both of
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both of them
assaulted me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I couldn't believe it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don&#8217;t
know if they knocked me down, but they did hurt me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was more hurt mentally.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I got no bruises.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It isn&#8217;t that
they're so strong or anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
may

there, so I was the next best
thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After they
left, and Eddie and
Mae came home, I told them what happened.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They got very upset, and Eddie called my father&#8212;I
think to borrow the
car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But my father
came along, and they
all went up to Mount Vernon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
next

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I dated a guy who was an artist,
Harold&#8212;I was so in
love.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was about
25.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I went out
with him, at the restaurant,
who should be there&#8212;somebody I hadn&#8217;t seen in years and years and
years:
Bea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was a
wonderful night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
night I went out for my first meal of
seafood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With my
father I&#8217;d had some
seafood, but never a complete meal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Everything was delicious.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We
went to City Island outside of the Bronx, near
Orchard Beach (20-25 minutes at the most), where everyone goes for
seafood.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I had everything.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I got violently ill that night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mentally&#8212;because I was taught I wasn&#8217;t allowed to
eat this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
brought up very religiously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I went out with Sam only once.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He&#8217;s a cheapskate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked me for a date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
had heard from Lily, who wanted me to come out to the beach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We went out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sam had been working; he
wasn&#8217;t unemployed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
took me out here, and these kids&#8212;the
young people&#8212;were going for soda or something.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We ended up eating something, and Sam walked out of
the restaurant so
other people had to pay, which was very embarrassing to me. So I never
went out
with him again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
think I sent him home
and I stayed with Lily that weekend, because I remember sleeping on a
couch
that was very, very uncomfortable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sam
was Eddie&#8217;s friend, and they were very good friends.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Harold was a guy I met who wasn&#8217;t a

evening, only I got very
very sick.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I threw
up all over the
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i style="">[Chuckle]</i><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You know, it was
all mental, because I&#8217;ve eaten seafood since but nothing ever happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time I got so sick
that I had pulled
my esophagus in such a way that I couldn't eat unless I had medication
before
each time I ate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
had to go to a
doctor because that was so sore, it took me three weeks to get over the
wrenching, the soreness in my esophagus.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That was a very trying time; it was horrible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Harold I dated for about two and
half
years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I even
brought him out to the
farm&#8212;you don&#8217;t remember.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
broke up
because he found someone else.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
that
point he loved me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
went to work and
played hookey from work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
had a
studio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
still an artist, a
commercial artist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
made money at
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never really
did anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He at
least made a living at it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
wasn&#8217;t a great artist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
didn&#8217;t do any painting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
painted me, which was very nice of
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He kept that;
it&#8217;s a big
painting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wish I
had it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did see
him once.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had
gone out to Jones Beach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
saw him and his wife and his daughters,
but he didn&#8217;t see me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
didn&#8217;t make an
issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">With Harold, I went out to the farm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Your mother and father put
us in separate
rooms, thinking that was fine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i style="">[Laughing]</i><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Your father is a real puritan.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When we left there, we stopped in Atlantic City and
stayed there over
night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did we stay
in separate rooms?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of
course not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Your parents didn&#8217;t say anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went back to the other

all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think we
were in separate beds,
not separate rooms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the living
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We stayed in
Atlantic City
overnight, then we traveled home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He
took me to very nice places.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
went to
the airport where we had dinner one day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was lovely.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Kennedy
Airport.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
Idlewild in those
day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had a
place to sit and view
the airplanes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
even had those in
my kitchen growing up, because we used to stay outside and watch the
planes
go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was a big

</span>We always had interesting things.<span style="">&nbsp;

was such a small car that one day he couldn't find a
parking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was
a parking that would
fit the car, but you couldn't get into it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So he had some kids lift it up and put it into the

was so bad, we spun around in a circle.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was on the highway.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">We never lived together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I lived with my
girlfriend, and he had his
own little room, which was very tiny, so there was no sense in moving
in together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And he
had a room in his parents&#8217; house with
all his art supplies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where
did he
paint?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I met
him, he had his own
studio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I saw him
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">We met each other again after I&#8217;d
had
children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s very
funny: I was going
to work&#8212;I was on a subway train&#8212;and sitting next to a friend of mine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We lived in a co-op then
in Queens.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And all
of a sudden, this guy stands in
front of me and says, &#8220;Hi!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
I
looked, and it&#8217;s him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then
he walked me
to work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
after one of Leo&#8217;s big
affairs; we had no relationship, he and I.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was like 40, I think.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Harold
was 5 years older than me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
we had
another affair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was a free-lance
artist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He didn&#8217;t
have any specific
times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And he met
me that day after
work, and I called Leo and said...<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I
had an excuse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
I was going to do
something with a friend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the second
affair with Harold, he lived in the city, not far from where I worked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had to take off half the
day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And we&#8217;d meet,
go out to dinner&#8212;lunch at
that time, go out to dinner later.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It
was very pleasant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was a nice
guy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Harold was
living separately at
that point, but he went back to his wife.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This affair lasted a few months.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Leo never questioned me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How could he question me?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never knew where he was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As long as he was willing
to take care of
the kids, at that point I could have my little affair.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I threw this at Leo when we broke up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because he had, like, 5, 6
affairs, and I
finally got one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
said to him, &#8220;You
know, I also had an affair.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
said,
&#8220;You did?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said,
&#8220;Yeah.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Harold.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It killed him, &#8216;cause he always accused me of still
seeing him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
very jealous, but he still had what
he wanted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
that&#8217;s all right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That&#8217;s
Leo for you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
don&#8217;t know about all men, but that was
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Anyhow, that&#8217;s my love life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had boyfriends...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Harold was the great love

on the farm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
remember Lou and Jean were fond of
David.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jean was
very nice to my
children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I
don&#8217;t remember my
father having anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
I moved to
a new apartment they bought me a vacuum cleaner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I got married, my father wanted to make the
wedding, but Ed

loved you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I feel like such a schmuck about
marrying Leo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
happens.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was only as good as I could be.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I was drawn to Leo because I wanted
children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Leo was
very good with children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
girlfriend had two children, and he was
wonderful with them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
he was
wondeful with any child I ever saw him with.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To me, Leo was going to be the ideal father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You can&#8217;t tell these
things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Who&#8217;d believe Leo could be the way
he is?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
eulogize him, his friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
mean, he&#8217;s still alive, but you&#8217;d think he
was the most wonderful person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
had
an 80<sup>th</sup> birthday and everybody came up and told
Sammy and Rebecca,
&#8220;Oh, your father is so wonderful, he must have been a wonderful father.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sammy felt like hitting
out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So did Rebecca.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">My neighbor can&#8217;t believe that the
Leo she knows can
be the one I told her about.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;He&#8217;s
so
sweet!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He&#8217;s always
nice to
everybody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But his
kids...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Iris won&#8217;t
even call him Daddy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
calls him Leo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
treated her worse than he treated the other two.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At least Sammy had love from him before
Rebecca was born.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once
Rebecca was
born, he didn&#8217;t bother with Sammy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I
got so mad that I couldn&#8217;t be good to Rebecca.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I felt very guilty about the attitude I had towards
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How could you
do this to a child?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How
could you ignore him?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
minute she was born it was like he
didn&#8217;t have a son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sammy
knows it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He felt
it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I&#8217;m not saying Leo never played with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he wasn&#8217;t important to
him any more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i style="">She </i>was.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When Iris came along, she was cute, but
everything was Rebecca.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
doesn&#8217;t even
remember what Iris does for a living.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I didn&#8217;t finish high school until
after Iris was born,
in 1958.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I
went back to
school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You go to
night school, it&#8217;s
different.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had to
take
everything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went
back with a friend
of mine, Hedie, who&#8217;s Hungarian and lives in Arizona now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She is very, very bright,
and wanted to have
her diploma from America.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
came over
just before the war.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
got very good
marks&#8212;the teacher told us, &#8220;You have the highest marks I&#8217;ve ever seen
from a
student.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t
think they were very
high, but at night you don&#8217;t get the brightest students.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I took English and math
and history.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
tests were not the way they were in
school&#8212;they were multiple choice, for reading more than anything else.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They gave you the story,
and then you had to
answer the questions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
you read and
know what you&#8217;re reading, you really don&#8217;t have a problem; but some
people skip
along and are not really understanding what they&#8217;re reading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I was very young, I
didn&#8217;t read, but by
that time I was an avid reader.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was
used to reading, and comprehension was a very big part of that test.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The thing I liked in math was
square roots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
loved them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can&#8217;t
do it any more.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That was my forte.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Naturally,
they gave that on the test, so I had no problem, whereas a lot of
people don&#8217;t
understand it to begin with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
thing
I can&#8217;t do is type.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
went back to school
to learn how to type, but I can&#8217;t.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I
have a block.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went to
North Pelham Parkway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
went off and on for a few years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
got my high school diploma.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
you go for a job and they ask how far
did you go, I don&#8217;t say I have a GED; I say, &#8220;Yeah, I finished high
school.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>GED still
doesn&#8217;t mean
something when you go for a job.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>GED
means I went back at night and took the tests.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Lily and Diane were Jean&#8217;s sisters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lily was a very nice
person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told me
that my father made a play for
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She rejected
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lily at that
time was a good-looking woman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
that she had psoriasis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
had rheumatoid arthritis, too, so she
was becoming very disfigured as far as her body, her hands in
particular.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
she died, Diane didn&#8217;t want me to come
to the funeral.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
my Aunt Mae
insisted I should go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
went to Diana&#8217;s
house after the funeral.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
I got
there, somebody said to Diane&#8212;and Aunt Mae was sitting right there, and
Jean
was still alive at the time&#8212;&#8220;Who&#8217;s that girl over there?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jean didn&#8217;t answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My aunt piped up, &#8220;What do
you mean that
girl?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That&#8217;s <i style="">Louis&#8217;</i> daughter.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Diane
never wanted anyone to know Jean had married a man with children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They couldn&#8217;t say anything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I was married to Leo at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;d had my second
miscarriage&#8212;I had a
miscarriage just before my father died, and just before Lily died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This miscarriage was
before Sammy, so it was
at least 42 years ago--1953.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">After that, when Jean died, again
it happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
kids were grown up already.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Diane
didn&#8217;t call to tell me that Jean
died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Diane called
my cousin Mike, Aunt
Mae&#8217;s son, and told him, and he called me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was on vacation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I left the
country where I was on vacation and came back to New York and went to <i style="">shiva</i> call.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She had a tremendous house, with a grand piano in
one room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The room
was so tremendous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
piano looked lost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
were people sitting there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Diane
put Leo and myself in the
kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Stay
here, stay here,&#8221; she
kept saying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;We&#8217;ll
talk here.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of
her twins walked in&#8212;both finally came
in&#8212;and they gave me a funny look and walked out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Like I had done something wrong.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We talked for awhile, and then we left because I
felt I was being kept
out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She walked out
of the room for a
moment, and I said, &#8220;You know, Leo, she doesn&#8217;t want us to go inside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She doesn&#8217;t want anybody
to know who I
am.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is an old
story with her, to
keep her sister protected, although her sister was dead now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never heard from her
again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Jean stayed with Diane before she
died, and I kept
telling Diane I want to come and visit her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Diane kept saying, &#8220;No, no, no, she&#8217;s not well
enough.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At one
point we finally went over to vist
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Diane was out
of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
one was there except for Jean.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
sat in the garden&#8212;whatever it was&#8212;the
back yard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
kept me isolated from
her, and she kept me isolated from them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was a very uncomfortable feeling, so I finally
stopped calling and
stopped trying to be nice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
only
lived 5 minutes from each other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Sylvia (Aunt Mae&#8217;s daughter) had
Stevie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
very domineering.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
stayed with me when she moved to New
Jersey.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was in
college then and
wanted to finish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
lived with us for
three years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
daughter in Israel had
asked me to do a family tree because she had to show it, and she wanted
something a little more than what her father could say.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">One day when I was 15, I was
babysitting with Ruth&#8217;s
children, and she was out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
turned my
back, and they were in a room that faced out on the street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I walked in and saw them
both sitting on the
window sill with their feet dangling.&nbsp; I
think it was the 2<sup>nd</sup> or first floor.&nbsp;
They were very young&#8212;like 2 and 3.&nbsp; I crept up on them, and I
grabbed them and banged their heads
together.&nbsp; I pulled them in from the window,
and I shut the window.&nbsp; I yelled at
them, &#8220;Never, ever do that again!&#8221;&nbsp; A
couple of hours later, Sid, Ruth&#8217;s husband, came home, and I told him
that they
had their feet dangling out of the window&#8212;and then I passed
out.&nbsp; I was so upset&#8212;they might have gotten
killed.&nbsp; In those days they didn&#8217;t have
laws&#8212;like nowadays if you have children that age, you have to put on
window
guards.&nbsp; It was real scary.&nbsp; I can still see it&#8212;two
gorgeous kids.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Another time, Steve had $10,000 in
the bank, and I
co-signed so I could take it out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They
lived in Israel, and Steve wanted to be able to get the money when he
wanted
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he did
this, his wife called
and said, &#8220;Please take the money out and send it to me.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, his brother,
Joel, who was living
in NY at the time, told me that Steve was gay.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Now Ava called for money.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This
was money that Steve had earned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
had a right to it, too, but I didn&#8217;t want to be the one who makes this
decision, so I told her there was a problem, and I couldn&#8217;t take it out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She and Steve got back
together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told
him that I didn&#8217;t know what to do,
and he said, &#8220;it&#8217;s all right, you did the right thing.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Steve and his wife lived in an
apartment in Israel
that&#8217;s very, very expensive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
has 4
bedrooms, and a terrace that&#8217;s as big as the roof of an apartment house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">My kids don&#8217;t like Ava.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m the only one she talks
to.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I&#8217;m the only one she&#8217;ll confide in.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She never told me about Steve&#8217;s extracurricular
activities.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
everybody likes to confide in me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His brother died.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">At one point, Stevie was going to
college, a number of
years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rebecca
was about 17&#8212;20 or
22 years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stevie
stayed with me in
New York because his mother had moved to Jersey, and he was going to
City
College.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stayed
with me about 4
years while he went.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
last year he
was with me, my Rebecca wanted to go away; she didn&#8217;t want to stay in
high
school in New York.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
I sent her out
to my cousin, Stevie&#8217;s mother, Sylvia, in New Jersey.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She enjoyed it to a point.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sylvia was an ill person; she had a bad heart.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We sort of exchanged: she
used to pay me something for Stevie&#8217;s
stay, so when she took Rebecca we just didn&#8217;t pay each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That&#8217;s where Rebecca met
Larry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had
another boyfriend before Larry, but
Larry fell in love with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
decided
to chase after her when she moved back to me, just before she graduated
from
high school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
last term was in
Lakewood.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">She loved it, but she didn&#8217;t have
any freedom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m a
much easier going person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sylvia
felt responsible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
the point to really restrict her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She had a daughter, Rita&#8212;Stevie&#8217;s sister&#8212;and
Rita decided that Rebecca was under her thumb.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She had two children who were little tubbies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rita had been married, and
the guy left her shortly after she had
her second child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
Rebecca lived there,
Rita made sure Rebecca cleaned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
was the old story again, with me cleaning and me doing, and now my
daughter was
doing this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ok:
you&#8217;re living there,
you have to help a little.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
she
couldn&#8217;t go visit her friends until she&#8217;d cleaned this and she&#8217;d
cleaned that,
and if there was any dirt left, Rita would yell and tell her mother,
who would
say, &#8220;Go back and clean it again.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They
were quite strict.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

it, the
baby doesn&#8217;t have a brain.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">She&#8217;s very important.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The hospital gives her increases because they say

have
nobody to take over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She

she worked at other
places that didn&#8217;t have unions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She&#8217;s
an excellent worker, but living with her husband, forget it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She teaches aerobics.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She would do it 5 days a

that she should vote the way he votes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He&#8217;s a Republican, he&#8217;s a very reactionnary-type
person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And with
me, she&#8217;s had to tell him off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was invited over, he invited his
secretary, and they were baiting me, calling blacks &#8220;niggers,&#8221; and the
like.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To me, this
is stupid and very
ignorant, and he did it to offend me.<span style="">&nbsp;

</span>Ask me
why.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m alive, and
his mother is
dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He can never
accept his mother&#8217;s
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never let
it get to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
father was a schmuck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He&#8217;s

won&#8217;t interfere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
don&#8217;t go there unless he&#8217;s away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I

said, &#8220;Listen, Rebecca.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
love my children, I love my

don&#8217;t love your
husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can&#8217;t

love somebody who can be like
that?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He&#8217;s very
ignorant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He may
make a lot of money, and he does, but
that doesn&#8217;t mean he&#8217;s a brain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He&#8217;s

lives with a
reactionary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he
knew half the things
that go on, he&#8217;d really get mad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
told me recently, Larry has no real friends.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Larry doesn&#8217;t like people.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His
family is the only important thing to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If that&#8217;s the way it is, that&#8217;s closing himself in a
box.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Larry could be
very sociable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just
stay off politics with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m
the one he treats the least nicely.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His brothers thinks I&#8217;m wonderful,
especially his older brother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
cook
like his mother cooked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
comes and
I&#8217;m cooking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
treat me very nicely,
his family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s
only he doesn&#8217;t.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
time she said, &#8220;He&#8217;s like this because
when his mother died, he resented anybody else.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His mother died, just before he started going with
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So she has a
mother, and he doesn&#8217;t.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s
ridiculous, and at this point in his
life he should be over it, but it&#8217;s his problem.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I&#8217;m not comfortable with him, and she knows it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And finally she admits, he
doesn&#8217;t like
people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What she&#8217;s
trying to say is,
&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t like you,&#8221; but she can&#8217;t say it that way.<span style="">&nbsp;

&#8220;No, Ma, I wasn&#8217;t that bright.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wellll,
she worked in my place with me, and the vice-president, I had to sit at

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I recently went to Florida to visit
a friend of mine
that I used to work with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
didn&#8217;t know
her well except to go to dinner or lunch with her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We liked going out to eat, so we got very friendly
that way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At one
point we were working together to get
people to vote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was done in the
building, and we had tables downstairs, and I said to her, by
accident&#8212;thinking
that she had voted, because she&#8217;s an American flag-waver&#8212;&#8220;Are you
registered?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
said, &#8220;No, I never
voted.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I
convinced her to
vote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Guess who she
voted for?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reagan!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It&#8217;s like throwing away my own vote.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I never would do that again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then recently, she&#8217;s retired, and I&#8217;m retired, and
she&#8217;s down in Florida
and she had open-heart surgery, and she called me, and I said, &#8220;Okay,
I&#8217;ll come
down to visit.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
mean, you have a
place to stay, you think it&#8217;s wonderful.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">So I went down to visit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First of all, she has a
kitchen with everything in it, including
a dishwasher.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
dishes are covered
with plastic so she never uses them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She does not cook.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She does not
use anything in her refrigerator.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I
said to her, &#8220;I have three meals a day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I am a diabetic now, and I must eat my three meals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can&#8217;t go without
breakfast.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Oh,
we&#8217;ll go to...&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
of the places that&#8217;s very cheap for
breakfast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But she
doesn&#8217;t want to go
before 11:00, because this is her breakfast-lunch.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So we went out and I bought some cereal and some
milk so I can
have breakfast in the morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
got my
milk and cereal so I had my breakfast every morning instead of coffee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I was only there four days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second day I&#8217;m there,
we drive, and she says to me, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t
this wonderful, there are no blacks around!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And I looked at her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She says,
&#8220;Well, they used to know their place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I
wish they knew their place now.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">And I said, &#8220;You know, Carol, they
were here way
before you or I.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know about that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother was born here.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She&#8217;s 62.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was this year.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She only
went down to Florida this past year.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Anyhow, I met a number of people
very similar to her
there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I would not go see her again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After that comment about
blacks I said,
&#8220;Carol, let&#8217;s not discuss politics, because you know we&#8217;re not going to
agree.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">She&#8217;s the type of
person who thinks everything&#8217;s a big
joke.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I never
knew when she was
kidding me when she corrected me constantly, or debated with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You got to a point where I
didn&#8217;t say
anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
couldn't talk.<span style=""> </span></span><br>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><a style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;" name="_Toc182190980"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"></span></a><a name="mimiconcludingcomments"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">EDITOR'S CONCLUDING COMMENTS
(written in 2000)</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 10pt;">To
avoid interrupting or influencing the flow of the
preceding narrative, I&#8217;ve put the following material at the end.
&nbsp;I call my aunt "mimi." &nbsp;She is also known in the
family as
Millie, Mink, Minkie.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I am very aware that there is no
such thing as
objectivity and that despite my efforts to the contrary, as a
transcriber (and
occasional editor) I have surely sometimes subtly changed exactly what
Mimi
says.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And sometimes
not so subtly:
simply by re-arranging and grouping thematic stories, I change the way
Mimi&#8217;s
mind roamed from one story to another and back again.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
I&#8217;ve made that choice because I believe the re-ordering will
help most readers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Indeed, I have often <i style="">not
</i>made &#8220;corrections&#8221; to many speech patterns because I
think part
of the integrity of the accounts is Mimi&#8217;s style of speaking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s too bad that I cannot
capture her
actual voice fluctuations, emphases, musical quality and the like to
give a
full sense of her tales.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Aside from thanking Mimi for taking
the extensive time
to reminisce and her patience as I asked questions, I want to thank
Élise for her contributions, which have enriched the
materials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one
but myself, however,
is responsible for the final content, and any mistakes or distortions
are my
sole responsibility.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Why did I do this with Mimi?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s quite selfish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
have always been fascinated by the role of memory in our lives, and I
have long
had a yen to know my past.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
father
had already written what he calls his memoirs, and that triggered my
desire for
more (and, I expected, sometimes competing) accounts of family history.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;ve also always felt
especially close to
Mimi (a fact greatly contributing to my guilt at taking four years to
transcribe the second half of this material: guilt itself is an
interesting
family trait worthy of discussion).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Then, too, there&#8217;s the academic in
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mimi&#8217;s and my
father&#8217;s memories are not just
tales to hand down the generations (and I trust that at least some of
our
descendants will treasure them); they also reflect a time and may offer
a few
nuggets for historians of social culture.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">No doubt vanity is also a motive:
by being the
initiator and transcriber, I thrust myself into the story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My son, Jason, has asked
me to recount
certain parts of my own past, and I shall indeed try to do so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The major problem with a living and
family history is
how far to be honest and complete, especially about those who are still
alive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not
everything that has happened
in the past is pretty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not
everyone who
appears in the story was virtuous&#8212;or, more accurately, some unvirtuous
behavior
is part of all our pasts, and few of us like to be reminded of it or
like to think
that after we&#8217;re dead others will know about it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On this theme, I commend to people Orson Scott
Card&#8217;s <i style="">Speaker for the Dead</i>, the
third book of
a compelling science fiction trilogy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A major theme of
that book is truth-telling in funeral orations, even when unpalatable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The principle&#8212;and I
believe this (though I
myself will likely go kicking and screaming before admitting some facts
of my
own life)&#8212;is that we gain nothing by censoring history, that in fact we
lose
something when we do.<span style="">&nbsp; (</span>When
I visited
New Orleans a couple of years ago, I learned that only one of the
ante-bellum
plantations open to tourists includes a visit to slave quarters.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Facts are inevitably
subjective, but when
prejudice and fear corrupt honest subjectivity into self-serving
myth-making,
we&#8217;re all in trouble.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">S</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">ince ultimately this is Mimi&#8217;s
account, I have cut a
few sentences she has decided not to include.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But I must say that this has been very little, and I
am impressed and
pleased by her willingness to retain as much as she agreed to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I hope that those who feel
uneasy about the
may Mimi has characterized them (my mother, whom I love, does not
always come
across sympathetically in Mimi&#8217;s eyes, yet I know from direct
experience that
they have often united in both personal and social causes) will honor
Mimi&#8217;s
personal truth and know that not everyone will necessarily see matters
the same
way.</span></p>

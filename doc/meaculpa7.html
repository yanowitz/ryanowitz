<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
classwork was all right, though I think I upset my English teacher, who wanted
to know if I had really read <i>The Last Days of Pompeii</i> or had seen the
movie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seems my descriptions of the
lava's flow followed the movie more than the book.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I swore I hadn't seen the movie, but she made me doubt
myself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Today, I think she was right.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
size made it imperative that I go out for the football team eventually, and
meanwhile I was invited to join the track team in order to get into
condition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ran the mile, eight
minutes? threw the discus, thirty feet? heaved the eight-pound shotput
mightily, ten feet?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wasn't that much
behind a lot of boys, but we were all outclassed by the varsity men.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite Hollywood, athletes don't get on
Broadway yesterday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wasn't weak, just
not adept.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I doubt that I could ever
have carried a full-grown bull around the arena though.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
father and Jean owned a Pekingese, which they'd named "Duke."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had bought him when he was small enough
to fit into my father's vest pocket. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>I
would tease that dog unmercifully, poking his bone with my foot, or threatening
to steal it from him as he spat like a cat trying to protect his property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think we had a love-hate
relationship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Out in the woods one day
I spied a young raccoon in a thicket and directed Duke's attention to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That cute little puppy dog became a ravenous
monster.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have never witnessed such
vicious, bloodthirsty slaughter since.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If Duke had been the size of a lion, he would have out-lioned any lion
alive.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
couldn't start any conversations with anyone, and if anyone started one with
me, it would usually die for want of fodder.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My father arranged a date for me with a sweet-looking innocent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He and Jean had arranged to play bridge at
her parents' house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think we went to
the movies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we got back at her
house, I kissed her dutifully and chastely on the lips and never saw her
again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most of my contacts with girls
had given me the impression that I was dealing with more sophisticated people
than myself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was such a naif, I
felt in the presence of a very young sister.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
film snapped here and I'm not sure of the correct splice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stopped going to school; probably because
it was the end of the semester.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
didn't graduate; probably because I didn't have enough credits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I went to work on my father's crew.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">While
my romantic notions about selling had been developed from my enjoyment of
watching people like Lee Tracy act in the movies, I found the real thing was
offensive.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
told Hy what I planned to do and he said he'd like to come along.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He didn't have much dough either but I told
him to come anyway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we gathered
together those things we thought we might need outside of clothing bodily
necessities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Benny couldn't come, but
he loaned me his surf fishing rod and reel in case Florida was what it was
cracked up to be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I took along my rod
and reel, hooks, lures, and whatever junk I thought might be useful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hy wasn't interested in fishing, but he came
along for the ride and whatever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
took along about forty dollars and I gave two hundred and forty to my Uncle
Irving to hold<span style="">&nbsp; </span>until I sent for
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It took a little<span style="">&nbsp; </span>begging to get him to agree, since he
thought we were mishugah, but my nagging won out.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Our
first adventure took place about ninety miles from New York at a railroad
crossing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no obstruction
between the car and a moving freight train that seemed nine miles long.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was the only driver, and ninety miles took
a long time then&#8211;before turnpikes and parkways crisscrossed the Eastern
Seaboard&#8211;so I leaned back and stretched.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The car was on a slight incline; and while my eyes were closed, it
inched forward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hy and Sammy both
shouted and I slammed my foot on the brake.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Too late.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Part of my bumper
accompanied the train.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
realized that we weren't very far from Allentown and suggested that we visit
some of our relatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We got a pretty
heavy come-uppance when we stopped at my Uncle Max and Aunt Sadie's house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I hadn't known about Hy's angry remarks to
Uncle Max's Aunt Sadie, so I was completely nonplussed when Danny ordered us
out of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, we were
warmly welcomed by Uncle Julius's Aunt Sadie, had dinner there, and were
invited to stay over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They understood
Daniel's anger, but they also understood the agony Hy felt.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
slept comfortably and Aunt Sadie fed us a huge breakfast and sent us on our way
with good luck wishes and kisses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
promised to stop on the way back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
were no questions, no recriminations, no "I told you so's.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
weather was fine and Route 1 was a two-lane highway that was straight at least
half the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had to contain my
impatience when I found myself driving behind ten-ton monsters that lumbered up
never ending hills at snail-speeds.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then, on reaching a navigable passing zone, I would step on the gas until
the reached speeds of at least forty to fifty miles an hour.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hy and Sammy would caution me not to be
reckless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I listened.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">It
felt wonderful to be in control of this slave to my whims on the
straightaways.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, driving through
Maryland, I misjudged a curve and had to turn the wheel too rapidly in order to
stay on the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As though it had been
waiting for just this opportunity, my careening slave taught me humility when
it slapped the road on the outside turn, righted itself, then insolently slapped
the road on the inside turn, jounced itself into equilibrium, stopped short,
and snorted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was impossible?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I looked for confirmation to my brother and my friend, but they were
both speechless and concentrating on recovering from the shock.</p>

the shock.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
was greedy to gobble up the miles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
drove long after the sun set, and decided to bed down only when my eyes started
closing on their own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The darkness was
scarcely less than pitch with the car's lights on high, but we found an ancient
hotel with a room that had two beds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
ever-ready imagination conjured up visions of crushing walls and vampires, but
my weariness overcame my fears and I slept. . . .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And awoke to find that the window looked upon a view equal in
beauty to any I have ever seen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
was a mountain rising higher and higher and a bluer than blue sky and fresher
air than any I had experienced&#8211;even in Van Cortlandt Park.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were probably in the Blue Ridge
Mountains.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Gas
was fifteen cents a gallon and the DeSoto loved to feed on it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My two riders cautioned me to take it easy
and I tried.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were going to Florida,
but I never liked to go straight to anywhere; I liked the diversions, the
detours, the side trips, so I suggested we go through Vulcan's city,
Birmingham.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Responding
affirmatively to Mrs. Brothers' Southern Hospitality, we enjoyed a good dinner,
some enjoyable parlor conversation and a pleasant overnight rest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. Brothers wished us "Bon
Voyage" when we left, but I wasn't sure her heart was in it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think, in retrospect, I was naive about
social relationships.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She may have
expected to be paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've found myself
overstaying welcomes since then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
guess I haven't read between the lines of smiling faces that were suggesting
hidden meanings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would have done
better if the meanings hadn't been so well hidden.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
bought groceries, drove, picnicked, drove all day and decided to save money by
sleeping in the car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ah, Youth!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We got some sleep and started driving at
dawn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I guess we were on the Tamiami
Trail by then, and we were driving through swampland.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had to crawl along through a heavy mist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cars surrounded by yellow auras from their
fog lights whooshed past me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the
road grew narrower and we were alone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If I drove with my brights, I could see nothing because of the reflected
light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My low beams picked up the white
line in the middle of the road&#8211;when it was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When it wasn't, I prayed, and that was pretty often.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
sun rose, the fog lifted, and things were looking up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think we must have been about fifty or sixty miles from Tampa,
Florida, when the car started lumbering; and when I stopped, I discovered the
front left tire was flat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Murphy's Law
must have existed before Murphy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had
the tools, so we assisted each other in changing the flat for the spare.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We missed one tiny, but important
consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However we discovered
our error shortly.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">At
times the adventurous spirit of the young (sometimes called stupidity) overcame
caution, though I didn't think an act was incautious or daring until I faced
consequences.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">We
had a pocket Ingersoll with a second hand and we noticed that the road was
bordered by mileposts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had not yet
discovered how speedy our old buddy was, and here we were handed a way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sammy timed the car as I floored the
accelerator from one post to the next.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Did
we make it?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Naaahhhh,
too slow."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Here
I go again."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Down went the
accelerator.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"You're
gonna make it!" yelled Sammy.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Pow!"
said a tire and shake, shake, shimmy, shimmy, grind, bump, squeal, whooooof!
went the DeSoto.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">At
various times in my sinful life God has tried to make me a believer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like other ingrates I've refused to
kowtow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was one time when he
staggered me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were on a
well-traveled state highway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cars had
been shooting past us going the other way at regular intervals; the road was
bordered by trees with substantial trunks, any of which would have totaled us
and the car at a sixty mph impact!</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">But
the waters of the Red Sea parted for the Israelites.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And our DeSoto, surely touched by the Hand of God, found its way
between two thick-trunked trees and squatted unharmed in soft brush.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Hy
and Sammy praised me for my landmanship, and I murmured modestly that I hadn't
been in control; the car had found its way.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I patted the wheel and we got out to assess the damage.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">There
weren't any new dents but I was kind of put out to discover that it was the
same wheel that had gone flat before that had blown out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hadn't fixed the flat before, but we had
the wherewithal and, though unfamiliar with the process, we had a pumped-up
tire ready to exchange for the damaged one in about half and hour.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was when we removed the wheel that we
discovered the tiny, but important error we&#8211;well, actually I&#8211;had made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I hadn't known that DeSoto wheels could be
put on backwards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both sides of the
wheels looked alike, but there were cogs which met channels when they were put
on correctly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If not, the wheel spun
and Pow!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I learned.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
have a hazy recollection of the car breaking down that evening outside of a
trailer camp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It required a major
repair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We rented a cabin for six
dollars a week for the three of us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
had a two-burner kerosene range, a large double bed, and a single hanging
electric bulb.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our first meal in our
suite was a combination of charred onions and canned spam, along with a loaf of
sliced white bread.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the meal we
discovered that those giant southern roaches when crushed smelled like almonds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was their subtle protection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have never stepped on another one.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
mechanic I called said it would cost at least fifty dollars to repair the
DeSoto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He'd have to send for parts and
he couldn't promise it for at least three weeks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sammy backed out then; he wrote home for train fare.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said he'd had some fun, but what could we
do for three weeks?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hy said he'd stick
around (I think he was being a big brother), and I was grateful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wrote to Uncle Irving for a hundred and
fifty dollars, but he sent a money order for<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the whole two-fifty with a one word unsigned note: Meshugeneh!</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
trailer camp had some permanent occupants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was a young fellow who looked perfectly healthy but had some
incapacitating disease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He beat me in
horseshoes by outrageous scores every time we played.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the transients, who was my partner in a bridge game one
night, predicted that orange juice would be shipped from Florida to the rest of
the country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All they had to do was
discover a way to prevent spoilage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
had been tried.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They'd<span style="">&nbsp; </span>canned it, frozen it, frozen the whole
orange, but nothing worked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would
though, he swore.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">There
was an orange grove about a mile down the highway and a cypress swamp a little
further on.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The giant trees had moss
hanging like feathery spider webs from their hairy arms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember being in a rowboat and moving
through the stillness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never saw an
alligator or a frog though.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Somehow
I got a ride into Tampa, but I can't remember anything except Disney's <i>Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfs</i> was playing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I think I saw people rolling leaf tobacco into cigars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That's all I remember about that city.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
weeks passed, the car was repaired, we said our goodbyes, took along two orange
crates full of oranges and were on our way.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We had very little money left and that went with the miles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We couldn't afford sleeping quarters and
slept in the car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A State Patrolman
woke us one morning in Georgia and we had visions of chain gangs, but he
checked my driver's license and sent us on our way.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
hydraulic brakes started to feel spongy a few miles past Roanoke and I was soon
reduced to down-shifting and using the emergency brake to slow and finally stop
the car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I started trading off our
valuables for necessities:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>gas, oil and
food, in that order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ran into a
stony-faced breed of gas station owners; they offered, and were immovable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They outfaced us and we crumbled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was finally forced to trade Benny's surf
rod and reel for five dollars and ten gallons of gas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I figured I'd repay him some way.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">To
avoid using the emergency brake, we sought roads through small towns and
succeeded to a degree, but there was no bypassing Washington.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The highway led us through the busiest
street in the Nation's Capital:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Fourteenth Street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dame Fortune
chose a particularly crowded time of day for me to arrive there, and I had to
stop not only at corners but several times between them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was encouraged as the blocks went by
however slowly, but became horrified when I smelled burning rubber and Hy
pointed to the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The constant use
of the emergency brake had started it smoldering and sending smoke trails up
through the floorboards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stopped the
car, holding up traffic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could feel
the gates of the penitentiary closing behind my sagging shoulders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Horns bleated, drivers cursed, but for five
solid minutes no cop appeared.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
started up, the smoke did not appear again, and I was freely driving on the
open highway&#8211;slowly&#8211;but moving towards our goal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then we came to our nemesis:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Bel Aire, Maryland.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was moving
along slowly on the highway when I noticed a sign which read "Avoid
Business Traffic," with an arrow pointing to the left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I immediately turned my wheel toward the
left and instinctively braked in the normal way&#8211;with my foot!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The car whipped around at twenty miles an
hour and slammed into a telephone pole.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The windshield was smashed and my hands were bloodied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hy had been kneeling on the front seat with
his back to the windshield fishing for an orange and was unharmed.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">Hy
took charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a doctor across
the street who charged a nominal fee for painting my cuts; there was a junkie
(cars) a half block down, who paid Hy ten dollars for the car and threw in five
more dollars for the two crates of oranges.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There were no cops!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
telephone pole was barely scratched.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hy
and I went merrily on our way with our meagerly packed suitcase.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">When
we reached Philly, Hy suggested that we owed Uncle Julius and Aunt Sadie a
call.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We protested mildly when Aunt
Sadie said that we must come by.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
took the trolley to Allentown, had a wonderful meal, a good rest, a fine
breakfast, thanked them profusely and headed for home.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
trouble was that there was no home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
dropped in at Aunt Mae's and she said hello rather distantly, but Ruthie
invited us to stay at her place for a couple days until we got settled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was "Gee whizzing" about it,
protesting feebly, but Hy accepted with gusto.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Minki was happy to see us and I went for a walk with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She complained bitterly about Aunt Mae's
keeping her busy all the time as if she were a servant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told her I'd get in touch with our father
and see if he'd do something about it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She said she'd told him and he'd said he had plans he was working on.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
called Uncle Irving at Gotham, hoping he had work for me, and he told me (after
a few smirky I told you so's) he had no work, but my father was in New York,
living with Jean at her parents' home in Boro Park.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He gave me the phone number and I spent a nickel on a call.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">My
father was happy to hear from me and asked me to come to Jean's parents' house
in Boro Park.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I spent a nickel on the
subway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I got there, I was
introduced to Jean's mother and father, her sister Lily, and Diana's husband
Jack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had already met Diana; she
worked at Gotham also.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lily was a
pleasant person, but she had<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a chronic
skin condition that had to be treated with creams which gave her an unsavory
appearance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was remarkably cheerful
for a thirty-year-old invalid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
parents were a little curious about their son-in-law's son, but my father cut
into the interrogations, and led me into the privacy of a bedroom.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
gist of what he had to say was that he had bought a gift shop in Memphis,
Tennessee, and he wanted to make a home down there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would use it as a base for selling pullbooks, I could take
care of the shop those times when Jean and he were out on the road, and Mildred
could go to school down there and have her own room in her own home.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"How
about Hy?" I asked.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Of
course, if he wants."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"When?"</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Today's
Monday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have to be there Friday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We'll start early Wednesday, sleep in motels
a couple of nights, and get there by noon Friday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We're renting half a house, so we have a place to stay."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"I'm
broke"</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"So?"
he smiled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Here's ten
dollars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Make it last till we go."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Okay."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Will
you speak to Mildred?"</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
nodded.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Where
are you staying?"</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Ruthie's."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Good.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'll pick you and Mildred up by eight
Wednesday morning.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Would you do me a
favor?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'd like to buy you some
clothes&#8211;a suit, shirts, shoes, whatever you need."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"Okay."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">"I
have to be in the fur market tomorrow, so meet me in front of 330 Seventh
Avenue at ten o'clock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's near
Twenty-Eighth Street."</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">I
spoke to Hy and he said no and I spoke to Mink and she was happy to leave Aunt
May.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I met my father the next morning
and he had to go to the Furrier's Union Hall on Twenty-Sixth Street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was like walking on Second Avenue with
Hy; every few steps he was greeted by someone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Naturally he introduced me and he friends made complimentary sounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It didn't make me feel good.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got the idea that I was being shown off
like a prized possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He introduced
me to Menscher, who was as tall as he'd said he was, though the man was
stoop-shouldered and didn't look as powerful as I had pictured a goon to be.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">At
the Union Hall he introduced me to all the business agents, the officers, the
workers; it became a ritual:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the proud
smile, the compliments, the handshakes, the nods, the "I'll see
you's."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wouldn't remember any of
them and I was sure they wouldn't remember me, but my father&#8211;oy did he
kvell&#8211;such a good looking son.</p>

<p class="stblpara0" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">He
bought me a $22.50 two-pants suit at Crawford's, a $3.33 pair of shoes at Thom
McCann's, socks and underwear, and a felt hat for $3.00!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was really going to be fahrpootzed in
Memphis.</p>
